Information and data were screened and extracted by 2 researchers. The obtained data were analyzed using the R software meta package. Quality assessment was conducted using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The causes of heterogeneity were analyzed using subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using Begger funnel plots and Egger test.  : The search strategy yielded a total of 21 studies involving 875 patients included in the final analysis. The pooled 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients with SLE-PH were 0.9020 (95%CI: 0.8576; 0.9397), 0.8363 (96%CI: 0.7813; 0.8852), 0.7301 (95%CI: 0.6327; 0.8181). The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of echocardiography subgroup were 0.9000 (95%CI: 0.8480; 0.9551), 0.8435 (95%CI: 0.7744; 0.9187), 0.6795 (95%CI: 0.5746; 0.8035), respectively; and there were 0.9174 (95%CI: 0.8951; 0.9402), 0.8529 (95%CI: 0.8255; 0.8812), 0.7757 (95%CI: 0.7409; 0.8121) at right heart catheterization subgroup in the meantime. Multivariate analysis for predicting mortality in SLE-PH patients revealed that diminishing left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association classification, lupus nephritis, lower cardiac index, and higher red blood cell distribution width level were significantly associated with a higher mortality rate. Treatment with huge doses of cyclophosphamide, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and Raynaud phenomenon signaled favorable outcomes.   The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of SLE-PH patients in recent years (0.9020, 0.8363, 0.7301) were estimated in this study. SLE-PH patients diagnosed by echocardiography have a worse long-term prognosis than those diagnosed by right heart catheterization. Studies after 2015 have shown significantly better survival than earlier studies.\",\n          \"The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a difference in overall survival (OS) between elderly patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and those who underwent surgery.  Methods Four databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and CKNI were searched on March 20, 2023. The characteristics of the studies and the baseline information of the patients, including their medical histories, postoperative data, and prognoses, were recorded. Odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled up to calculate baseline information and postoperative information. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were used to calculate the prognosis of the patients. Stata V16.0 software was used for the data analysis.   A total of eight studies involving 2334 patients were included for the data analysis in this study. After pooling up the data, we found that the ESD group had lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupprevious (ECOG) scores (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.33, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.17 to 0.65, I2\\u2009=\\u200959.69%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.00\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than the surgery group.

Cardiac side effects such as QT prolongation and torsades de pointes (TdP) have also been observed with fluoroquinolones currently on the market. In order to evaluate the cardiac risk of fluoroquinolones as a class, and the comparative risk for each individual drug, we conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis.    MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched, up to March 2018, for randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that investigated the association between fluoroquinolone treatment and the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. We followed the PRISMA 2009 guidelines for data selection and extraction. Outcomes were pooled using random effects models. Direct and indirect comparisons in network meta-analysis were performed using frequentist methods.    Thirteen studies were included in our analyses. Fluoroquinolone use was associated with a statistically significant 85% increase in the risk for arrhythmia (odds ratio [OR] 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.81) and 71% increase in the risk for cardiovascular mortality (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.39-2.09). Moxifloxacin ranked most likely to have the highest risk for arrhythmia (P-score 0.99) and for cardiovascular mortality (P-score 0.95) by network meta-analysis.    Our findings show a significant association between fluoroquinolone use and an increased risk for arrhythmia and cardiovascular mortality. Moxifloxacin ranked with the highest probability for cardiovascular adverse events.

To determine whether PH in these patients is similar, we compared the clinical characteristics, hemodynamics at diagnosis, and survival in groups of patients with SLE\\u2013PH and IPAH. We reviewed the case records of 20 patients with SLE\\u2013PH and 34 patients with IPAH, who had been assessed by echocardiography or right cardiac catheterization at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, from January 1995 to October 2003. Clinical features, laboratory data, chest X-rays, electrocardiogram , pulmonary function tests, pulmonary perfusion scans, echocardiographic findings, serologic profiles, and survival were compared in the two groups of patients. The mean follow-up period was 18.1\\u00b120.6 months for patients with SLE\\u2013PH and 33.0\\u00b123.4 months for patients with IPAH. During follow-up, 12 SLE\\u2013PH (60%) and 11 IPAH (32%) patients died. For SLE\\u2013PH, the 3-year survival rate was 44.9% and the 5-year survival rate was 16.8%. For IPAH, the 3-year survival rate was 73.4% and the 5-year survival rate was 68.2% (p=0.02). There were no other significant differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory data between the two groups. In contrast to previous reports that the prognosis of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with collagen vascular disease was better than that of patients with IPAH, we found that the prognosis of patients with SLE\\u2013PH was much worse than that of patients with IPAH. MP: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a series of clinicopathological syndromes associated with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure caused by various reasons, and is also the most serious complication of connective tissue disease (CTD). This study aims to evaluate the clinical features and prognostic factors of CTD associated PAH (CTD-PAH) patients in the Chinese Han population, and provide a reference basis for improving their prognosis.    A total of 392 individuals with CTD between January 2017 and August 2021 were included in this study. They were divided into two main groups: CTD-PAH and CTD-non-PAH. The independent sample t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare clinical and laboratory findings. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were converted into binary variables to determine the critical value. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the survival rates of the two groups. And an analysis of death risk factors was conducted using Cox regression.   In this study, SLE was the most common underlying disease among Chinese Han patients with CTD-PAH (51.56%). The level of anti-U1-RNP antibodies was significantly higher in the CTD-PAH group as compared to the CTD-non-PAH group (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), whereas the levels of anti-SCL-70 antibodies were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). CTD patients with higher anti-U1-RNP antibodies levels were at high risk for PAH (P\\u2009=\\u20090.021), whereas higher levels of anti-U1-RNP have also been linked to decreased mortality in CTD-PAH (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In addition, the anti-SCL-70 antibody was an independent protective factor for CTD-PAH (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029). The poor prognosis of CTD-PAH was associated with high RDW (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), NLR (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), CAR (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and pulmonary infection (P\\u2009=\\u20090.008).   Patients with CTD who have higher levels of anti-U1-RNP antibodies are at high risk for PAH, whereas higher levels of anti-U1-RNP antibodies have also been linked to decreased mortality. An increase in the anti-SCL-70 antibody levels is an independent protective factor against CTD-PAH. High CAR, NLR, RDW and pulmonary infection are also significant determinants of total mortality in patients with CTD-PAH.\\\" MP:The present cross\\u2011sectional study investigated the clinical characteristics and survival of patients with three types of connective tissue disease associated with pulmonary hypertension (CTD\\u2011PH) diagnosed early by echocardiography. A total of 218 patients with CTD\\u2011PH were included in the present study. Patients with the three major types of CTD, namely systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and primary Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS), were included. PH was diagnosed based on pulmonary arterial systolic pressure >35 mmHg, as measured by Doppler echocardiography. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory  and echocardiographic parameters were collected and analyzed. The Kaplan\\u2011Meier method was used to calculate survival rates. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent factors affecting mortality. Compared with patients with CTD with pSS (6.5%) or SLE (3.8%), those with SSc had a higher prevalance of PH (12.9%). Patients with SSc\\u2011PH had the highest rate of lung involvement (81.2%) and 42.2% of patients were classified as World Health Organization\\u2011function class III/IV at the time of diagnosis with PH. The overall survival rate among patients with CTD\\u2011PH at 1, 3 and 5 years was 81.4, 72.4 and 56.9%, respectively. Patients with SLE\\u2011PH appeared to have the most favorable prognosis and patients with SSc\\u2011PH had the poorest relative outcomes. Multivariate analysis revealed that age \\u226550 years was the only independent risk factor for mortality. In conclusion, among the patients with CTDs investigated, the prevalence of PH was highest among those with SSc. Patients with SSc\\u2011PH had the highest prevalence of pulmonary involvement, the lowest survival rate and the worst prognosis. MP:We sought to investigate the characteristics, survival and risk factors for mortality in Chinese patients with connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH) in modern therapy era.   129 consecutive adult patients who visited one of three referral centres in China with a diagnosis of CTD-APAH confirmed by right heart catheterisation during the previous 5 years were enrolled. The end-point was all-cause death or data censoring.   Systemic lupus erythematosus was the most common underlying CTD (49%) and systemic sclerosis just accounted for 6% in this cohort. The overall survival at 1 and 3 years was 92% and 80%, respectively. Pericardial effusion, a shorter 6-min walk distance, lower mixed venous oxygen saturation, higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lower total cholesterol levels were all associated with a higher risk of death among the study population. Higher PVR and ALP were independent predictors of mortality.   In conclusion, unlike in western patients, systemic lupus erythematosus is the most common underlying disease in Chinese patients with CTD-APAH. The survival of Chinese patients with CTD-APAH in the modern treatment era is similar to that in western countries. Elevated PVR and ALP are independent risk factors for poor outcomes.\\\" MP:Pulmonary arterial hypertension in association with connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH) has historically had a poor prognosis, with a 1-year survival rate among patients with systemic sclerosis\\u2013associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH) of 45%. However, more therapies have become available.   To investigate the survival and characteristics of all patients diagnosed with CTD-PAH in the U.K. pulmonary hypertension service.   National registry of all incident cases of CTD-PAH diagnosed consecutively between January 2001 and June 2006.   Patients with CTD-PAH (429; 73% SSc-PAH) were diagnosed by a catheter-based approach. One- and 3-year survival rates were 78 and 47% for patients with isolated SSc-PAH. Survival was worse for those with respiratory disease\\u2013associated SSc-PAH (3-yr survival, 28%; P = 0.005) whereas survival among patients with exercise-induced SSc-PAH was superior (3-yr survival, 86%; P = < 0.001). Age, sex, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and World Health Organization functional class were independent predictors of survival in isolated SSc-PAH. Nineteen percent of patients with exercise-induced SSc-PAH and 39% of patients with isolated SSc-PAH who were in functional classes I and II had evidence of disease progression. The prevalence of diagnosed SSc-PAH is 2.93 per 1 million. The 3-year survival rate of 75% for those with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE-PAH) was significantly better than that for patients with SSc-PAH (P = 0.01).   Survival of patients with SSc-PAH in the modern treatment era is better than in historical series. A significant proportion of patients with mild functional impairment or exercise-induced SSc-PAH have evidence of disease progression. Survival of patients with respiratory disease\\u2013associated pulmonary hypertension is inferior. SLE-PAH has a better prognosis than SSc-PAH.\\\" MP: This study aims to identify the factors associated with the development and mortality of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients.   We conducted a prospective study of SLE patients in a single tertiary center. PH was defined as a systolic pulmonary arterial pressure \\u226530\\u2009mmHg on transthoracic echocardiography. We assessed potential associated factors contributing to the development and mortality of PH in SLE patients.   Of 1110 patients with SLE, 48 patients were identified to have PH. Multivariable analysis indicated that pleuritis or pericarditis (odds ratio (OR)\\u2009=\\u20094.62), anti-RNP antibody (OR\\u2009=\\u20092.42), interstitial lung disease (ILD) (OR\\u2009=\\u20098.34) and cerebro-cardiovascular disease (OR\\u2009=\\u200913.37) were independently associated with the development of PH in SLE. Subgroup analysis among patients with PH demonstrated that there were no statistically significant factors associated with PH mortality in SLE.   The prevalence of PH was 4.3% in our cohort. There were significant associations with pleuritis or pericarditis, anti-RNP antibody, ILD, and cerebro-cardiovascular disease in SLE, which may contribute to the development of PH. However, there were no statistically significant factors associated with PH mortality in SLE.\\\" MP: No population-based study has investigated the cumulative incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the survival impact of PAH in this population.    We used a nationwide database in Taiwan and enrolled incident SLE patients between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013. The cumulative incidence of PAH in the SLE patients and the survival of these patients were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Potential predictors of the development of PAH were determined using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.    Of 15,783 SLE patients, 336 (2.13%) developed PAH. The average interval from SLE diagnosis to PAH diagnosis was 3.66\\u2009years (standard deviation [SD] 3.36, range 0.1 to 13.0\\u2009years). Seventy percent of the patients developed PAH within 5\\u2009years after SLE onset. The 3- and 5-year cumulative incidence of PAH were 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Systemic hypertension was an independent predictor of PAH occurrence among the SLE patients (adjusted hazard ratio 2.27, 95% confidence interval 1.59\\u20132.97). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of SLE patients following the diagnosis of PAH were 87.7%, 76.8%, and 70.1%, respectively.   PAH is a rare complication of SLE and the majority of PAH cases occur within the first 5\\u2009years following SLE diagnosis. Systemic hypertension may be a risk factor for PAH development in the SLE population. The overall 5-year survival rate after PAH diagnosis was 70.1%.\\\" MP:This study aimed to identify the long-term clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) confirmed by right heart catheterisation.   A multicentre prospective cohort of SLE-associated PAH was established. Baseline and follow-up records were collected. The primary end-point was death. The secondary exploratory end-point was treatment goal achievement (TGA), defined as an integrated outcome.   In total, 310 patients were enrolled from 14 PAH centres. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 92.1%, 84.8% and 72.9%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year TGA rates were 31.5%, 53.6% and 62.7%, respectively. Baseline serositis, 6-min walking distance >380\\u2005m and cardiac index \\u22652.5\\u2005L\\u00b7min\\u22121\\u00b7m\\u22122 were identified as independent prognostic factors of TGA. Patients with baseline serositis were more likely to reach TGA after intensive immunosuppressive therapy. TGA was identified as a positive predictor of survival in patients with SLE-associated PAH.   TGA was associated with long-term survival, which supports the treat-to-target strategy in SLE-associated PAH. Baseline heart function predicted both survival and treatment goal achievement in patients with SLE-associated PAH. Patients with serositis at baseline tended to benefit from intensive immunosuppressive therapy and have a better clinical outcome.\\\" MP: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious and devastating complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially when the right ventricle (RV) fails. Whether the ratio between tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) measured by echocardiography as a simple surrogate of RV to pulmonary circulation (PC) coupling predicts the outcome of SLE-associated PAH has not been investigated.    Between February 2010 and August 2015, 112 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of SLE-associated PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization were enrolled prospectively. The endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and clinical worsening. Baseline clinical characteristics and echocardiographic assessment were analysed. Among all the patients, 47 (42%) patients experienced the endpoint (mean follow-up period 18.1\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200912.0\\u2009months), including 20 patients who died during a median follow-up period of 48.5\\u2009months. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that TAPSE/PASP ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 0.004, P\\u2009=\\u20090.017] and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) (HR 0.997, P\\u2009=\\u20090.036) were the independent predictors for the endpoint. A three-group prediction risk was created based on combined assessment of the TAPSE/PASP ratio and 6MWD relative to their cut-off values. The patients with the worse RV-PC coupling (TAPSE/PASP <0.184\\u2009mm/mmHg) and the lower 6MWD (<395\\u2009m) had the highest risk (HR 4.62, confidence interval 2.27\\u20139.41, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) of experiencing the endpoint.   The TAPSE/PASP ratio, combined with 6MWD, provides clinical and prognostic insights into patients with SLE-associated PAH. A low TAPSE/PASP and low 6MWD identifies the subgroup of patients with high risk of poor prognosis.\\\" MP:Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).    We identified all patients with SLE and PAH (SLE-PAH) who were enrolled in the French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry with a diagnosis confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC). A control group of 101 patients with SLE without known PAH was selected from SLE expert centers participating in the Pulmonary Hypertension Registry. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios associated with potential predictors of death were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.    Of the 69 patients with SLE-PAH identified in the French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry, 51 were included in the study. They did not differ from the control group regarding age, sex, or duration of SLE at the time of the analysis but had a higher frequency of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. The delay between SLE diagnosis and PAH diagnosis was 4.9 years (range, 2.8-12.9) years. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.4% (95% CI, 76.2%-96.5%) and 83.9% (95% CI, 68.8%-92.1%), respectively. The survival rate was significantly better in patients with anti-U1-RNP antibodies (P = .04).    Patients with SLE-PAH have an overall 5-year survival rate of 83.9% after the PAH diagnosis. Anti-SSA/SSB antibodies may be a risk factor for PAH, and the presence of anti-U1-RNP antibodies appears to be a protective factor regarding survival.\\\" MP:We investigated whether transthoracic echocardiography-suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH) affects survival in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and examined factors associated with PH occurrence and survival.    This retrospective single-center study included 154 Korean SLE patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria (January 1995 to June 2013). Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank tests were used for comparisons.    A total of 35 SLE patients with PH (SLE/PH+) and 119 without PH (SLE/PH-) were analyzed. Higher percentages of interstitial lung disease, Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), World Health Organization functional classification III/IV, and cardiomegaly were found in SLE/PH+ compared to SLE/PH-. Furthermore, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index was significantly higher in SLE/PH+ (2.46 \\u00b1 1.245 vs. 1.00 \\u00b1 1.235), whereas survival rates were significantly higher in SLE/PH- in log-rank tests (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the adjusted mortality hazard ratio (HR) for SLE/PH+ patients was 3.10. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of lupus nephritis in the SLE/PH+ patients who died (p = 0.039) and low complement-3 levels (p = 0.007). In univariate analysis, the mortality HR for SLE/PH+ patients with lupus nephritis was 4.62, whereas the presence of RP decreased the mortality risk in multivariate analysis; adjusted HR, 0.10.   PH is an independent factor predicting survival in SLE patients. The presence of lupus nephritis resulted in an increased trend for mortality, whereas coexistence of RP was associated with a better survival prognosis in SLE/PH+ patients.\\\" MP:Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We investigated the characteristics of SLE patients with PH. The patients with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure more than 30 mmHg at rest on echocardiogram were diagnosed with PH. Echocardiography was done only in patients with clinical or radiological evidence suggesting PH. Right heart catheterization was not performed. We identified 10 SLE patients with PH between 1980 and 2000. We compared their clinical and laboratory parameters with those of 97 consecutive SLE patients without PH. Nine of the ten patients with PH were females. The mean age at the time of SLE onset was 25.2 \\u00b1 6.9 years; the mean duration of follow-up was 93.4 \\u00b1 52.8 months, and the interval between the onset of SLE and PH diagnosis was 9.0 \\u00b1 4.6 (5\\u201321) years. Antiphospholipid antibody positivity was significantly higher in the PH group (80 vs. 36%; p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between two groups in regard to secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. The frequency of Raynaud\\u2019s phenomenon was higher in PH group (60 vs. 27%; p < 0.05). Renal involvement (80 vs. 43%; p < 0.05), neuropsychiatric involvement (40 vs. 7.2%; p < 0.005) and serositis (70 vs. 14.4%; p < 0.001) were significantly more frequent in the PH group. The mean damage score in patients with and without PH were 4.0 \\u00b1 2.4 and 0.4 \\u00b1 1.0, respectively (p < 0.001). Four patients with PH died during the follow-up. This study reveals that the presence of PH defines a subgroup of patients with a severe disease and increased mortality. Antiphospholipid antibodies and Raynaud\\u2019s phenomenon may contribute to the pathogenesis of PH. We recommend that all patients with SLE, especially those positive for antiphospholipid antibodies and/or with signs of Raynaud\\u2019s phenomenon should be regularly evaluated for the development of PH. MP: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and could be an acute critical condition presenting to the emergency department (ED). Our previous retrospective study revealed that the ED-related mortality of such patients was over 50%. The aim of the current prospective study is to initiate a proactive intense care strategy on severe SLE-PAH patients in the emergency setting and evaluate its impact on the short-term survival.   The proactive intense care strategy was applied, which includes: (i) an education and training course on the topic of SLE-PAH for ED physicians; (ii) a SLE-PAH patient triage protocol with prompt specialist consultation and admission; and (iii) intensive care with prompt initiation of combination PAH-targeted therapy, that is, at least two drugs from the three categories as represented by iloprost, bosentan and sildenafil. Consecutive SLE-PAH patients with WHO functional class III or IV who attended the ED were enrolled following the aforementioned protocol. A historical group of SLE-PAH patients in the ED (n = 11) was set up as a comparison, and 3-month short-term survival was calculated.   During October 2010 to December 2012, a total of 11 consecutive severe SLE-PAH patients were included in the present study. Compared with the historical group, an improved short-term survival can be appreciated over time (historical group vs. proactive group, 27.3% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.033). The application of PAH-targeted combination therapy apparently contributed to the better outcome (P = 0.0099).   Proactive care and combination PAH-targeted treatment can improve short-term survival of severe SLE-PAH in the emergency setting.\\\" MP: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a major cause of mortality in connective tissue disease (CTD). The survival rates and mortality-predictive factors of a nationwide registry of Korean patients with CTD-PH measured by echocardiography were determined.    Patients with CTD-PH were enrolled between April 2008 and December 2012. Hemodynamic parameters and clinical data (WHO-functional class [FC], organ involvement, laboratory tests and treatment agents) were recorded. Survival rates were calculated by using the Kaplan\\u2013Meier method. Mortality-associated factors were examined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.    In total, 174 incident PH cases (61 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 50 with systemic sclerosis, 10 with mixed CTD, 22 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 31 with other CTDs) were diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography. Of these, 25 (14%) died during the 3.8 \\u00b1 2.7 year follow-up period after PH diagnosis. The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 90.7% and 87.3%, respectively. Compared to the other CTD-PHs, RA-PH had the lowest survival rates (56% 3 year survival; P = 0.022). Multiple regression analysis revealed that low diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), pleural effusion and diabetes mellitus were poor prognostic factors (P = 0.008, 0.04 and 0.009, respectively). Anti-UI-RNP (ribonucleoprotein) antibody positivity was protective (P = 0.022). In patients with WHO-FC III/IV, patients who received vasodilators had lower mortality than those who did not (P = 0.038).    In Korean patients with CTD-PH, the 3-year survival rate was 87%. Low diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), pleural effusion and diabetes mellitus were independent poor prognostic factors. Anti-UI-RNP antibody was protective. Prompt PAH-specific vasodilator therapy may improve the survival of patients with severe CTD-PH.\\\" MP:Survival rate and causes of death according to the period of diagnosis and four accompanying organ disorders were analyzed in 306 Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The survival rate was gradually improved, and the survival rate during 5- and 10-year periods of the patients diagnosed in 1990\\u20132004 was 94 and 92%, 20-year period of those in 1980\\u20131989 was 77%, 30-year period of those in 1975\\u20131979 was 71%, respectively. Survival rate of those with serositis, pulmonary hypertension, and positive family history tended to be reduced, while that of the cases with neuropsychiatric disorder and renal disorder was significantly reduced. Overlapping of these organ disorders was an important factor for a poor prognosis. Bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular accidents were frequent causes of death, and treatment for anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome and life-style diseases such as hypertension and arteriosclerosis was thought to be important for a good outcome. MP:Based on the characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SLE-PAH), Sun et al has put forward a scoring system to distinguish two clinical phenotypes as vasculitic and vasculopathic subtypes[1]. A weighted score \\u22652 suggested a vasculitic subtype by combining two factors: The time interval between SLE and PAH diagnosis <2 years and \\u22652 years were 1 and 0 point; SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) >9, 5-9 and <5 were 2, 1, 0 point, respectively. While the vasculitic subtype seemed to have poorer prognosis in Sun\\u2019s research, other study has shown controversial result[2].   To find out the prognosis of two distinct clinical phenotypes of SLE-PAH.   Between 2008 and 2019, a SLE-PAH cohort confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) from Guangdong Provincial People\\u2019s Hospital was included. Other groups of pulmonary hypertension were excluded. Based on the scoring system, patients were divided into vasculitic (weighted score\\u22652) and vasculopathic subtypes (weighted score<2). The endpoint was PAH-related mortality. Survival status were confirmed by clinic follow-up data or phone call.   A total of 53 SLE-PAH patients were enrolled. The cases of vasculitic and vasculopathic subtype were 14 and 39, respectively. Ten endpoint events occurred. Eight attributed to PAH and the cause could not be traced in two which were still included in study. The pooled 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates were 85.7%, 78.6%, 65.5% in vasculitic subtype, and 93.9%, 87.5%, 87.5% in vasculopathic subtype, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed vasculitic subtype tended to have a poorer prognosis than vasculopathic subtype (p=0.16, HR 2.4, 95%CI 0.5-13.8, figure 1).\\\"\",\n          \"MP: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a difference in overall survival (OS) between elderly patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and those who underwent surgery.    Four databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and CKNI were searched on March 20, 2023. The characteristics of the studies and the baseline information of the patients, including their medical histories, postoperative data, and prognoses, were recorded. Odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled up to calculate baseline information and postoperative information. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were used to calculate the prognosis of the patients. Stata V16.0 software was used for the data analysis.    A total of eight studies involving 2334 patients were included for the data analysis in this study. After pooling up the data, we found that the ESD group had lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupprevious (ECOG) scores (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.33, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.17 to 0.65, I2\\u2009=\\u200959.69%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.00\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than the surgery group. There were significant differences in the operation time (MD\\u2009=\\u2009-3.38, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u2009-5.19 to -1.57, I2\\u2009=\\u200998.31%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.00\\u2009<\\u20090.05), length of hospital stay (MD\\u2009=\\u2009-3.01, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u2009-4.81 to -1.20, I2\\u2009=\\u200998.83%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.00\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and hospitalization expenses (MD\\u2009=\\u2009-2.67, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u2009-3.59 to -1.75, I2\\u2009=\\u200993.21%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.00\\u2009<\\u20090.05) between the two groups. The ESD group had a lower OS rate (HR\\u2009=\\u20092.81, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20092.20 to 3.58, I2\\u2009=\\u200912.28%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.00\\u2009<\\u20090.05).    Elderly patients with EGC who underwent ESD had a significantly worse OS rate than those who underwent surgery. If the patient\\u2019s condition was suitable, surgery was still recommended for these patients.\\\" MP: Surgery is recommended for early gastric cancer (EGC) beyond the endoscopic resection (ER)-indication for the risk of lymph node metastasis; however, ER may be chosen as a \\u201crelative ER-indication\\u201d considering age and comorbidities. This study aimed to compare outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) only and surgery (primary surgery and additional surgery after non-curative ESD) among elderly patients with relative ER-indication EGC and to further assess prognostic factors.    Outcomes of ESD and surgery (417 cases; 114 ESD, 303 surgery) in elderly patients (\\u226575\\u2009years) with relative ER-indication EGC were retrospectively analyzed. Prognostic factors were also examined.    During the observation period (median; ESD, 34\\u2009months; surgery, 61\\u2009months), 29% of ESD and 35% of surgery patients died, including 4% and 5% from gastric cancer (GC), respectively. ESD showed lower overall survival (OS) than surgery (P\\u2009=\\u20090.027) but comparable disease-free survival (P\\u2009=\\u20090.916). OS-associated factors were age and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in males (age \\u226579, hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001; PNI <45, HR 2.06, P\\u2009=\\u20090.031) and age in females (age \\u226582, HR 4.06, P\\u2009=\\u20090.004). Treatment was not a prognostic factor in either subgroup. Pathological category \\u2265pT1b2 (submucosal invasion \\u2265500\\u2009\\u00b5m) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were significantly associated with GC death (mortality: \\u2265pT1b2, 7.7%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002; LVI, 10.1%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001).    In elderly patients with relative ER-indication EGC, ESD may have comparable long-term efficacy to surgery, and treatment selection had a minor contribution to OS. For patients with poor preoperative prognostic factors, diagnostic ESD may be performed first, followed by additional surgery based on pathological .\\\" MP: Little is known about the clinical and oncologic outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) compared with surgery in elderly patients with early gastric cancer (EGC).  To evaluate the clinical and oncologic outcomes of ESD compared with surgery in elderly patients with EGC of an expanded indication.  Retrospective study with propensity-matched analysis.  University-affiliated tertiary-care hospital, Seoul, South Korea.  A total of 518 patients 70 years of age or older with initial-onset EGC.  ESD and surgery.  Clinical outcomes, disease-free survival, and overall survival.  In a propensity-matched analysis of 132 pairs, the length of hospital stay of the ESD group was shorter than that of the surgery group (median [interquartile range], 4 [3\\u20134] vs 9 [7\\u201311] days; P < .001). Intensive care unit admission occurred in the surgery group only (7 patients [5.3%]). Two surgery-related deaths occurred in the surgery group (1 splenic artery bleeding and 1 anastomosis site leakage). During follow-up, metachronous lesions developed more often in the ESD group than in the surgery group (12 vs 2 lesions, P = .004). All recurred lesions were successfully treated endoscopically except for 3 patients who refused additional treatment. Overall survival did not differ between the 2 groups (P = .280). Limitations Nonrandomized, retrospective study.  ESD is a safe procedure in elderly patients with EGC. Although the risk of metachronous lesions is higher in patients who undergo ESD than in those who undergo surgery, overall survival did not differ between the patients who undergo ESD and surgery.\\\" MP:The Japanese population is rapidly aging, and the actual number of elderly patients with gastric cancer, including early cancer, has been increasing, even though the standardized incidence of gastric cancer in the population is decreasing. The optimal treatment for these patients remains a challenge to the surgeon. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to describe the  of gastrectomy and EMR for early gastric cancer in elderly patients (80 years of age and over).   This is a retrospective review of 93 elderly patients who had undergone gastrectomy or EMR at the National Cancer Center Hospital for early gastric cancer. EMR was performed aiming en bloc local resection with a clear curative margin (R0). The clinicopathologic characteristics, comorbidity, postoperative mortality, and outcome were recorded.   Gastrectomy was performed in 44 patients (surgery group) and EMR in 49 patients (EMR group). There were significant differences in mean tumor size (p < 0.05), histologic type (p < 0.05), and depth of tumor invasion (p < 0.05) between the two groups. There was no significant difference in comorbidity between the two groups. No operative death was reported in either group. In the EMR group, 7 patients were reported to have recurrence of local disease and two patients died of advanced disease. There were no significant differences in the overall 3-year survival rate or the 5-year survival rate between the surgery group and EMR group (73.5% vs. 82.5% and 55.0% vs. 62.5%, respectively).   EMR (R0) resection was performed safely in the elderly, and the overall  were excellent, the same as the  with gastrectomy. Gastrectomy can still be performed if EMR is unsuccessful.\\\" MP: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is sometimes performed for early gastric cancer (EGC) which is not indicated for endoscopic resection (ER) in elderly patients considering old age and comorbidities. We aimed to compare outcomes between ESD and surgery in elderly patients with EGC that is not indicated for ER.    Elderly patients aged\\u2009\\u2265\\u200975 years who underwent either ESD or surgery for EGC which was not indicated for ER between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively investigated.    Among a total of 294 patients, 59 (20.1%) and 235 (79.9%) patients underwent ESD and surgery as the initial treatment, respectively. The ESD group had smaller size of tumors (25 vs. 30 mm, p\\u2009=\\u2009.001) and higher rate of differentiated-type cancer than the surgery group had (88.1% vs. 60.9%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). With a median observation period of 91.8 months (range 11.6\\u2013198.1 months), 141 (48.0%) patients died: 25 (42.4%) and 116 (49.4%) patients in the ESD group and the surgery group, respectively. Overall survival and disease-free survival between the two groups had no significant differences (p\\u2009=\\u20090.982. p\\u2009=\\u20090.155, respectively).    ESD may be an alternative option for EGC which is not indicated for ER in elderly patients aged\\u2009\\u2265\\u200975 years, considering old age and comorbidity.\\\" MP: To establish whether gastrectomy for early gastric cancer (EGC) in elderly patients is related to poor survival.    The subjects of this retrospective study were patients aged\\u2009\\u2265\\u200975 years with primary stage IA EGC, who underwent curative resection with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or surgery.    We analyzed data on 365 patients who underwent ESD and 170 patients who underwent surgery. Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different for the ESD group vs. the surgery group (5-year cumulative rates, 81.5% vs. 79.7%; log-rank test, P\\u2009=\\u20090.506). Multivariate analysis revealed that treatments; namely, ESD or surgery, were not associated with OS (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.77\\u20131.51). Similar  were observed even in the subgroups with worse conditions, such as age\\u2009>\\u200980 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2\\u20133, Charlson comorbidity index\\u2009\\u2265\\u20092, and prognostic nutritional index\\u2009\\u2264\\u200946.7. Using propensity score matching, we selected 88 pairs of patients who underwent ESD or surgery with baseline characteristics matched and found that OS was not different between the two groups (log-rank test, P\\u2009=\\u20090.829).    OS was comparable for elderly patients who underwent ESD and those who underwent surgery for EGC. Surgical invasiveness did not worsen the prognosis, even for elderly patients.\\\"\",\n          \" MP:     The goal was to determine the incidence of symptomatic adenoidal regrowth after adenoidectomy.    A cross-sectional follow-up study was done in a randomly selected group of 175 children who had undergone adenoidectomy 2 to 5 years earlier. Nasopharyngoscopy was performed in those children who still had symptoms of nasal obstruction.   : All surgery was performed at an academic hospital-based practice in the northeastern United States by a single surgeon using a consistent operative technique.    Forty-six (26%) patients had nasal airway obstruction symptoms at follow-up. Of the 35 who agreed to undergo nasopharyngoscopy, not a single one had adenoids occupying more than 40% of the nasopharynx, and most (71%) were found to have either no or only trace amounts of adenoidal tissue (usually in the pharyngeal recess).    Adenoids rarely, if ever, regrow enough to cause symptoms of nasal obstruction after adenoidectomy that includes visualization and electrocautery of the adenoid bed.   MP:     Determine if pediatric patients undergoing adenoidectomy for obstruction have an increased likelihood of undergoing eventual tonsillectomy and/or second adenoidectomy over extended follow-up.    Retrospective cohort study within the ambulatory surgery component of a tertiary children's hospital. Exclusion criteria consisted of the presence of significant co-morbid conditions (obesity, craniofacial syndrome, cerebral palsy, etc.) and less than 1 year of post-adenoidectomy follow-up. The study population included 100 children (mean age=3.9 years, range 0.9-15 years) randomly selected from a financial billing database undergoing adenoidectomy either with pre-operative obstructive symptoms (OB n=52) or without pre-operative obstructive symptoms (NOB n=48) with a minimum of 1 year of retrospective follow-up. Electronic records were searched for subsequent surgery (tonsillectomy and/or revision adenoidectomy).    Overall, 29 of 100 children (29%) underwent subsequent surgery (tonsillectomy and/or revision adenoidectomy) over an average of 3.46 years (range 1.0-6.59 years) retrospective follow-up. Children in the OB group were three times more likely (age, sex adjusted odds ratio=3.03, 95% confidence interval =1.18-7.78 p=0.021) than children in the NOB group to require tonsillectomy or second adenoidectomy. Age less than 2 years at time of initial adenoidectomy also suggested an increased likelihood of subsequent surgery.    Children undergoing adenoidectomy with obstructive symptoms are more likely to require eventual tonsillectomy and/or second adenoidectomy than those undergoing adenoidectomy without obstruction. However, the low absolute likelihood of future surgery precludes a generalized recommendation for tonsillectomy in these children.   MP:     We aimed to determine the need for revision adenoidectomy following the standard technique of blind curettage with digital palpation.    Within a district general hospital, we undertook a retrospective study of 3231 children who underwent adenoidectomy between 1996 and 2003, 53 of whom required revision adenoidectomy. The main outcome measure was the number of children needing revision adenoidectomy.    A total of 53 children required a repeated operation for recurrence of symptoms (1.6 per cent); of these, 42 were for treatment of glue ear, five were for nasal symptoms and six were for adenoidal infection.    Adenoidectomy performed without vision may be one of the reasons for recurrence of symptoms. Residual adenoids are acknowledged in the literature as one of the complications of the traditional technique. We highlight the fact that the need for revision adenoidectomy is not uncommon and suggest that we should improve our surgical technique in the UK by visualization of the postnasal space either by a mirror or an endoscope.   MP:     When introduced, suction coagulation was initially utilised for haemorrhage control following curettage of the adenoid pad. More recently the whole procedure has been performed using the technique. This study aims to report post-operative haemorrhage rates and risk of recurrence in adenoidectomy performed solely by suction diathermy in children.    A retrospective study of 1411 consecutive paediatric patients. Surgery was performed using suction diathermy. No patients were excluded. All patients were followed up.    There were no cases of post-operative haemorrhage. 1.7% of patients remained symptomatic and underwent revision adenoidectomy. None required a third procedure.    Re-growth of adenoid tissue may occur despite visualisation of the nasopharynx at the time of surgery. The incidence of re-growth is similar to that reported in patients undergoing conventional adenoidectomy by curettage. Post-operative haemorrhage was not encountered in children having adenoidectomy by suction diathermy. The authors suggest suction diathermy as the most appropriate method for adenoidectomy in children.   MP:     Adenoid   re-growth   is a poorly understood phenomenon. While parents often express concerns regarding the potential for adenoid   re-growth  , little information exists in the literature about its incidence and causation.  Purpose: To establish the incidence and possible contributing factors leading to adenoid re-growth in children.   : Retrospective case series review.   : Tertiary care children's hospital.    The charts of 106 patients who underwent revision adenoidectomy between 1995 and 2006 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients were excluded because the primary adenoidectomy was performed elsewhere or initially only a partial adenoidectomy was performed. In the remaining 72 patients, demographic data, clinical presentation, associated medical conditions and findings at surgery were studied.    During the 11-year study period. 13,005 adenoidectomies or adenotonsillectomies were performed; 72/13,005 (0.55%) underwent revision adenoidectomy. The mean (+/-S.D.) age at presentation for primary adenoidectomy was 3.68+/-2.9 and 7.69+/-4.04 years for secondary (  revision  ) adenoidectomy with an average time interval of 4.3 years between surgeries. Age at initial adenoidectomy was not a significant factor in predicting revision adenoid surgery. 29/72 (40%) underwent a reflux work up including scintiscan with gastric emptying, 24h pH probe, or laryngoscopy. 28/29 (96%) were diagnosed with reflux. At least 15/72 (21%) were reported to have symptoms consistent with adenoid re-growth which were found to be caused by tubal tonsil hyperplasia.    Revision adenoidectomy rarely needs to be performed. Tubal tonsillar hyperplasia, as opposed to re-growth of residual adenoid tissue previously removed, accounts for some cases. Extraesophageal reflux is a possible cause in some and requires further study.   MP:     To evaluate the benefit of endoscopic examination after adenoidectomy in detecting residual adenoid tissue that would need completion surgery, in ultimate aim to reduce rates of adenoid recurrence.    A total of 312 children were included in the study conducted at Ain-Shams University Hospital from January till December 2007, following routine adenoidectomy, 118 had a nasal and nasopharyngeal rigid fiberoptic examination and 194 did not, randomly according to the surgical subunit that performed the surgery. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years for recurrence of symptoms of adenoid enlargement.    Endoscopic examination revealed that 14.5% of patients undergoing adenoidectomy had residual adenoid tissue that needed further removal, of these the most common site was at the lateral walls of the nasopharynx (47%). The recurrence rate of adenoid hypertrophy needing re-surgery with endoscopic examination (0.85%) approaches that of the lowest recorded (0.5%) with more expensive and costly methods, and statistically significant lower than rates when endoscopy is not performed (5.6%). Additional time needed for such examination was negligible in terms of cost-benefit relationship.    Rigid fiberoptic endoscopy of the posterior choana and nasopharynx at the end of adenoidectomy provides the benefit of detecting unremoved adenoid tissue without significantly extra cost, time, nor expertise, and helps reduce significantly the rates of recurrence of adenoid enlargement, which might be attributed to residual   missed   adenoid tissue.   MP:   Objective/  Adenoidectomy is a frequently performed procedure in the pediatric population. Revision rates and indications for a second procedure in children are scarce.    Retrospective cohort study.    Patient records at a multistate pediatric healthcare system were searched for all CPT codes that included adenoidectomy in children less than 12 years of age for a 5-year period (2005-2010). A subset of patients was identified for whom the same CPT codes appeared more than once in this 5-year period. The indication, age, gender, adenoid size, and technique of adenoidectomy were recorded.    A total of 23,612 occurrences of the CPT codes were identified. The subset of patients with multiple CPT codes, indicating revision adenoidectomy, included 304 records (1.3%). Mean age at first procedure was 2.8 years (SD = 1.7 years). Mean age at second procedure was 4.7 years (SD = 1.99 years). Mean interval between procedures was 1.8 years (SD = 1.1 years).    Revision adenoidectomy occurs at a rate of 1.3%. Reasons for revision include persistence symptoms ranging from adenoiditis to recurrent otitis to obstructive sleep apnea.   MP:     To determine whether patient factors (eg, indication for initial surgery, medical comorbidity, or age) are associated with adenoid regrowth and subsequent need for revision adenoidectomy and whether surgical factors (eg, surgical technique or level of surgeon's training) are associated with adenoid regrowth and subsequent need for revision adenoidectomy.    Historical cohort study.   : Tertiary care academic medical center.  Subjects and   Children (\\u226418 years) who underwent adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy between 1980 and May 2009 were identified. Medical and surgical records were reviewed for sex, age at surgery, indication for surgery, training level of surgeon, surgical technique, and history of allergies, asthma, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.    Of 8245 surgical cases (53.8% male), 163 were revision adenoidectomies. Age at initial adenoidectomy was a significant factor for revision adenoidectomy, with younger ages associated with higher increased risk. Indication for adenoidectomy was also a significant risk factor; adjusted for age, patients with ear rather than infectious indications were about 10 times more likely to require revision. A diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease was a significant risk factor (hazard ratio, 2.23; P = .002).    Several risk factors are associated with revision adenoidectomy: young age at initial procedure, indication for adenoidectomy, and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Surgical technique, level of experience of the initial surgeon, and diagnosis of asthma or allergies were not significant risk factors for revision adenoidectomy.   MP:     To determine the rate of repeated adenoidectomy in children and examine the risk factors associated with this condition.   A retrospective nested case-control study was performed. All cases of adenoidectomy performed at a single pediatric institution between 1990 and 2010 were examined. A total of 168 children who had undergone a repeated adenoidectomy were identified. A 1:1 matched case-control study was performed. The data were analyzed using a conditional logistic analysis.   : Single tertiary pediatric institution.  Patients: Children aged 0 to 18 years having undergone at least 1 adenoidectomy.  Main outcome measures: Risk factors associated with repeated adenoidectomy.    A total of 10 948 adenoidectomies were performed in the study period. The rate of repeated adenoidectomy was 1.5% (168 cases). The mean age at first adenoidectomy was significantly lower in the repeated adenoidectomy group (P < .001), and children younger than 5 years at the time of adenoidectomy were 2.5 times more likely to require a repeated procedure. The case-control study identified a strong association between adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy and repeated adenoidectomy, with children who had undergone a repeated adenoidectomy having a 3.68-times higher odds (95% CI, 2.10-6.45) of having an adenoidectomy alone.    Age younger than 5 years and adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy were identified as important risk factors for repeated adenoidectomy in children. Parents should be made aware of the increased risk of adenoid regrowth if surgery is performed at a young age. Children undergoing adenoidectomy alone should be followed up carefully to monitor for symptom recurrence.   MP:     No studies are available specifically comparing revision rates between suction coagulator and microdebrider-performed adenoidectomies. Our objective was to compare revision adenoidectomy rates between these instrument groups.    Historical cohort study.   : Patients included in this study had surgery at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, from June 2007 through December 2011.  Subjects and   The patients were divided into 2 groups based on technique of adenoidectomy used at the time of initial surgery and the regrowth rate analyzed.    During the 4.5-year study period, the microdebrider was used in 4071 adenoidectomies, and 3328 cases were performed with suction coagulation. There was a revision rate of 0.84% (34 patients) for the microdebrider group. The rate was 1.50% (50 patients) for suction coagulation. This difference was found to be statistically significant on univariate analysis. The suction coagulator group had a younger mean age at initial surgery and a higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. No difference in revision rates between the 2 groups was noted on multivariate analysis.    Symptomatic regrowth of adenoid tissue occurs infrequently. Both suction coagulation and microdebrider methods are commonly used when performing adenoidectomies due to more consistent ease of use in removal of tissue. The incidence of regrowth likely relates to variables other than the technique used, as there was no difference in the regrowth rate between the 2 groups.   MP:     To evaluate population-based data on incidence of pediatric adenoidectomy and rate of revision surgery.    A retrospective study of all adenoidectomies in children was performed in the year 2009 in all otolaryngology departments in one federal state, Thuringia, in Germany. Patients' characteristics, preoperative diagnostics and postoperative complications were analyzed. The association between baseline characteristics and the risk of re-adenoidectomy was examined using Kaplan-Meier method with univariate log-rank test, and with a multivariate Cox regression model. Population data were used to calculate age-related annual rates of adenoidectomies.    1939 adenoidectomies were performed in 2009 in Thuringia. 89% were primary cases and 11% of the children already had an adenoidectomy prior to 2009. Immediate re-surgery because of primary hemorrhage was necessary in 0.8% of the cases. Re-adenoidectomy because of recurrent symptoms was needed in 9% of patients after a median interval of 16 months. The univariate analysis showed that the factors age \\u22643 years and primary surgery were significantly associated to a higher risk of surgery because of recurrent symptoms The multivariate analysis showed that primary surgery was independently associated with the risk of re-surgery (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.74). The annual adenoidectomy rate was 678/100,000 underage habitants. The incidence was highest between 2 and 4 years of age.    This population based analysis is showing that adenoidectomy is performed country-wide with good results and low risk on important scale in daily routine by otorhinolaryngologists. The risk of re-adenoidectomy seems to be higher than hitherto reported by hospital-based studies.   MP:    To analyze the prevalence of adenoid regrowth at 1 year after coblation adenoidectomy using cephalometric radiography.    Retrospective analysis.    One hundred eighty-eight children who underwent adenoidectomy from June 2006 through September 2010 were included. Demographic data, preoperative size of palatine tonsils, presence of allergic rhinitis, concurrent operation of recurrent middle ear effusion, and preoperative and postoperative Korean version of Obstructive Sleep Apnea-18 (KOSA-18) scores were analyzed. The size of the adenoids was measured three times in all the children by lateral cephalometry; preoperatively, at 1 month after adenoidectomy to observe adenoid residual; and at 1 year after surgery to observe adenoid regrowth.    The adenoid regrowth at 1 year after adenoidectomy was observed in 25 children (13.3%), and the adenoid residual at 1 month after surgery was observed in 11 children (5.9%) in the cephalometry. Seven of the 11 children with residual disease (63.6%) had adenoid regrowth at 1 year. The regrowth group was significantly younger than no regrowth group, and the preoperative adenoids were larger in regrowth group than in no regrowth group. The symptoms of sleep disordered breathing recurred in two patients and they had revision adenoidectomy.    The regrowth rate of the adenoids at 1 year was not low. However, most of the patients were asymptomatic. The adenoid residual at 1 month contributed to regrowth at 1 year, and the risk factors of the adenoid regrowth were younger age and larger initial size of the adenoids.    MP:     Adenoidectomy is one of the most commonly performed pediatric operations worldwide. There are a proportion of children who require revision adenoidectomy. Yet there is little in the literature about the incidence, associated factors and etiology of adenoidal regrowth. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine incidence and factors associated with revision adenoidectomy.    An extraction of all hospital morbidity records belonging to patients under the age of 18 years who underwent one or more adenoidectomy procedures (with or without tonsillectomy) between January 1, 2000 and June 2016 at a tertiary care children's hospital was performed. Demographic, diagnostic, and procedural data were included in the analysis. Community prescribing information was examined for the number of courses of antibiotics prescribed to each patient prior to initial adenoidectomy.    There were 8260 patients under the age of 18 years who underwent primary adenoidectomy from 2000 to 2016 at a tertiary pediatric hospital. 2.5% (n = 212) of patients underwent revision adenoidectomy in our cohort during the same time period. A higher proportion of females underwent revision adenoidectomy when compared to male counterparts (p = 0.007). Patients who were prescribed more than five courses of antibiotics prior to initial adenoidectomy were more likely to undergo revision adenoidectomy (p = 0.003). Patients with a diagnosis of otitis media with effusion were more likely to undergo revision adenoidectomy (p=<0.001). A diagnosis of asthma (p=<0.001), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (p=<0.001), and allergic rhinitis (p=<0.001) was associated with revision adenoidectomy. An age of over 4 years at the time of initial adenoidectomy was associated with revision adenoidectomy (p=<0.001). Adenoids that obstructed over 75% of the nasal choanae were associated with revision adenoidectomy in this cohort (p=<0.001).    This study has identified several factors associated with revision adenoidectomy.  MP: There is a lack of population-level analysis of revision adenoidectomy in children. This study reveals the revision rates and factors associated with paediatric revision adenoidectomy in Taiwan. From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified all in-hospital children (age <18 years) who underwent adenoidectomy between 2000 and 2007. All children had received at least 5 years of follow-up from the index date, and the clinical records until 2012 were examined. Factors affecting the paediatric revision adenoidectomy were analysed using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 10,396 children were enrolled (mean age 7.3 years; 66% boys; mean follow-up period 8.7 years). Two hundred and seventy-five children underwent revision adenoidectomy, and the mean interval between primary adenoidectomy and revision surgery was 2.97 years. Only 58.5% of children underwent revision surgery at the initial hospital. The incidence of revision surgery was highest in the second year (0.69%), followed by the third year (0.53%) after primary adenoidectomy. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed that young age [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.8], male gender (HR = 1.57), surgery at an eastern hospital (HR = 2.08), surgical indication of adenoid hypertrophy (HR = 1.51), and concurrent ventilation tube insertion (HR = 2.61) or nasal surgeries (HR = 4.84) were associated with revision adenoidectomy. The incidence of revision adenoidectomy in Taiwan was 2.6%. Male gender, young age, concurrent nasal or ventilation tube insertion, and surgery at an eastern hospital increased the risk of revision.   MP:  Objectives  Evaluate the effects of electrocautery, microdebrider, and coblation techniques on outpatient pediatric adenoidectomy costs and complications. Study    Observational retrospective cohort study. Methods  An observational cohort study was performed in a multihospital network using a standardized accounting system. Children < 18 years of age who underwent outpatient adenoidectomy were included from January 2008 to September 2015. Cases with additional procedures were excluded. The cohorts were divided into children who underwent electrocautery, microdebrider, or coblator adenoidectomy. Data regarding costs, postoperative complications, and revision surgeries were analyzed. Results  A total of 1,065 cases of adenoidectomy were performed with electrocautery (34.9%), microdebrider (26.1%), and coblation (39.0%). There was an increased after direct cost associated with the microdebrider, $833 (standard deviation [SD] $363) and the coblator, $797 (SD $262) compared to the electrocautery, $597 (SD $361) (P < 0.0001). There was a greater overall operating room (OR) time associated with use of the microdebrider (mean 28.7, SD 11.0 minutes) compared with both the electrocautery (mean 24.7, SD 8.1 minutes) and coblator (mean 26.2, SD 9.8 minutes) (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was found with regard to complication rates. The incidence of repeat adenoidectomies was significantly greater for microdebrider (9.7%) compared to electrocautery (2.7%; P = 0.0002) and coblator (5.3%; P = 0.0336) techniques. Conclusion  These results suggest that adenoidectomy with electrocautery is significantly less expensive than microdebrider and coblator, with no differences in complication rates or surgical times among the techniques. Microdebrider adenoidectomy was associated with a longer overall OR time and a higher rate of adenoid regrowth, requiring revision surgery.  MP: Approximately 130,000 adenoidectomies are performed each year in the United States. Few studies have examined adenoid regrowth and the incidence of revision surgery or have compared four different surgical instruments commonly used for adenoid surgery within the same institution. This study aimed to determine the incidence of revision adenoidectomy after the use of microdebrider, Coblation, suction cautery, and curette instruments over a 10-year period at a single major tertiary children's center in the United States. A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent primary and/or revision adenoidectomy at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) between August 2004 and August 2014. During the 10-year study period, a microdebrider was used in 212 cases, Coblation in 382, suction cautery in 1,926, and curette in 3,139 adenoidectomies. The percentages of revision adenoidectomy were 1.42% (3 patients) for microdebrider, 0.79% (3 patients) for Coblation, 0.36% (7 patients) for suction cautery, and 0.03% (1 patient) for curette. The cumulative incidence of revision adenoidectomy for initial surgeries performed at CHLA was 0.2% for the 10-year study period. Pearson chi-square analysis showed statistically significant differences between the surgical techniques (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, regrowth of adenoid tissue requiring revision surgery occurs very infrequently irrespective of the instrument used for the primary procedure, and the most common indication for revision adenoidectomy is to improve eustachian tube dysfunction rather than nasal obstruction due to adenoid hypertrophy. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, the potential of tDCS to enhance sport-specific motor performance in athletes remains elusive. Objective  We aimed at analyzing the acute effects of a single anodal tDCS session on sport-specific motor performance changes in athletes compared to sham. Methods  A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The meta-analysis was performed using an inverse variance method and a random-effects model. Additionally, two subgroup analyses were conducted (1) depending on the stimulated brain areas (primary motor cortex (M1), temporal cortex (TC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CB)), and (2) studies clustered in subgroups according to different sports performance domains (endurance, strength, visuomotor skill). Results  A total number of 19 studies enrolling a sample size of 258 athletes were deemed eligible for inclusion. Across all included studies, a significant moderate standardized mean difference (SMD) favoring anodal tDCS to enhance sport-specific motor performance could be observed. Subgroup analysis depending on cortical target areas of tDCS indicated a significant moderate SMD in favor of anodal tDCS compared to sham for M1 stimulation. Conclusion  A single anodal tDCS session can lead to performance enhancement in athletes in sport-specific motor tasks. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the modes of action as a function of performance domain or stimulation site, these results imply intriguing possibilities concerning sports performance enhancement through anodal M1 stimulation.\",\n          \"The effect of stress on Graves' disease (GD) is controversial. Our purpose was to quantify the impacts of stress on patients with Graves' disease.   Systematic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsycInfo were conducted from inception to 1 January 2023. Studies comparing the incidence of stressful life events (SLEs) that occurred before diagnosis and during drug therapy in cases diagnosed with GD and controls were included in the final analysis.  : Nine case-control studies and four cohort studies enrolling 2892 participants (1685 [58%] patients) were included. Meta-analysis revealed a high and significant effect-size index in a random effect model (d = 1.81, P = 0.01), indicating that stress is an important factor in the onset of GD. The relationship between SLEs and GD was stronger in studies with higher proportions of female patients (\\u03b2 = 0.22, P < 0.01) and weaker in studies with older patients with GD (\\u03b2 =-0.62, P < 0.01). However, stress did not significantly affect the outcome of antithyroid drug therapy for GD (d = 0.32, P = 0.09).  Conclusions: The  of this meta-analysis suggest that stress is one of the environmental triggers for the onset of GD. Therefore, we recommend stress management assistance for individuals genetically susceptible to GD, especially for young females.\",\n          \"Novel disease-specific and mechanism-based treatments sharing good evidence of efficacy for migraine have been recently marketed. However, rembursement by insurers depends on treatment failure with classic anti-migraine drugs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify and rate the evidence for efficacy of flunarizine, a repurposed, first- or second-line treatment for migraine prophylaxis.   A systematic search in MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed for trials of pharmacological treatment in migraine prophylaxis, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). Eligible trials for meta-analysis were randomized, placebo-controlled studies comparing flunarizine with placebo. Outcomes of interest according to the Outcome Set for preventive intervention trials in chronic and episodic migraine (COSMIG) were the proportion of patients reaching a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, the change in monthly migraine days (MMDs), and Adverse Events (AEs) leading to discontinuation.  : Five trials were eligible for narrative description and three for data synthesis and analysis. No studies reported the predefined outcomes, but one study assessed the 50% reduction in monthly migraine attacks with flunarizine as compared to placebo showing a benefit from flunarizine with a low or probably low risk of bias. We found that flunarizine may increase the proportion of patients who discontinue due to adverse events compared to placebo (risk difference: 0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06).  Conclusions: Published flunarizine trials predate the recommended endpoints for evaluating migraine prophylaxis drugs, hence the lack of an adequate assessment for these endpoints. Further, modern-day, large-scale studies would be valuable in re-evaluating the efficacy of flunarizine for the treatment of migraines, offering additional insights into its potential benefits.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"MP\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 400,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MP:[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of whole body vibration (WBV) on static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and the disability of patients with chronic lower back pain. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were of 40 patients, who were randomly assigned to WBV and control groups. Twenty-five minutes of lumbar stability training and 5 minutes of WBV were conducted for the WBV group, and 30 minutes of lumbar stability training was conducted for the control group. The training was conducted three times per week for a total of 6 weeks. Static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and disability were measured before and after the intervention. [] After the intervention, the WBV group showed a significant differences in static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and disability. The control group presented significant differences in pain, and disability. In the comparison of the two groups, the WBV group showed more significant improvements in the fall index and pain. [Conclusion] WBV can be recommended for the improvement of the balance ability and pain of chronic lower back pain patients.  MP:   This 2-step prospective randomized parallel trial evaluated postural stability in 65 back pain participants (61.6\\u00b17.9 y) and 50 nonback pain participants (61.2\\u00b18.6 y) in a first step using the MFT-S3-Check. In a second step, postural stability and questionnaires were evaluated in back pain participants before and after therapy with either whole body vibration therapy or classic physiotherapy.   The first aim was to investigate whether the MFT-S3-Check is suitable to evaluate differences in postural stability in back pain and nonback pain participants. The second aim was to evaluate the effect of whole body vibration therapy and classic physiotherapy on postural stability and the influence of depressive symptoms and pain.  Objective bodily measurement values in chronic back pain are rare; therefore, the evaluation of effectiveness of different therapies is difficult.   Postural stability was investigated using stability-, sensorimotor-, and symmetry indexes, in standing and seated positions with the MFT-S3-Check. The following standard questionnaires were used to investigate pain and depressive symptoms: HADS, ODI, NASS, SF-36.   No significant difference in postural stability was found between back pain participants and the nonback pain group. None of the two training concepts in back pain participants was superior, concerning postural stability and pain. Both treatments showed positive effects, with significant improvements in postural stability in the classic physiotherapy group. Depressive symptoms had a significant correlation with pain intensity in back pain participants.  Conclusions: The MFT-S3-Check could not find a significant difference in postural stability between the back pain and nonback pain group in the study setting. Postural stability improved after treatment.\\\" MP:   To confirm the benefits of whole-body vibration exercise for pain intensity and functional disability in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.   Single-blind randomized controlled trial.   Outpatient.   Eighty-nine patients with non-specific chronic low back pain met the inclusion criteria, they were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (n = 45) or the control group (n = 44).  Intervention: The intervention group received whole-body vibration exercises three times a week for 12 weeks. The control group received general exercise protocol three times a week for 12 weeks.  Main outcomes: The primary outcome measures were pain intensity and functional disability measured by the visual analog scale scores and Oswestry Disability Index. The secondary outcome measures included lumbar joint position sense, quality of life (Short Form Health Survey 36) and overall treatment effect (Global Perceived Effect).   A total of 84 subjects completed the 12-week study program. After 12 weeks, compared with the control group, the mean visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased by additional 1 point (95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.22 to -0.78; P < 0.001), 3.81 point (95% CI, -4.98, -2.63; P < 0.001) based on adjusted analysis in the intervention group. And the intervention group provided additional beneficial effects for in terms of lumbar joint position sense (P < 0.05), quality of life (P < 0.05), and Global Perceived Effect (P = 0.012).   The study demonstrated that whole-body vibration exercise could provide more benefits than general exercise for relieving pain and improving functional disability in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.\\\" MP:   A randomized controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up period was conducted.   To compare lumbar extension exercise and whole-body vibration exercise for chronic lower back pain.  Chronic lower back pain involves muscular as well as connective and neural systems. Different types of physiotherapy are applied for its treatment. Industrial vibration is regarded as a risk factor. Recently, vibration exercise has been developed as a new type of physiotherapy. It is thought to activate muscles via reflexes.   In this study, 60 patients with chronic lower back pain devoid of \\\"\\\"specific\\\"\\\" spine diseases, who had a mean age of 51.7 years and a pain history of 13.1 years, practiced either isodynamic lumbar extension or vibration exercise for 3 months. Outcome measures were lumbar extension torque, pain sensation (visual analog scale), and pain-related disability (pain disability index).   A significant and comparable reduction in pain sensation and pain-related disability was observed in both groups. Lumbar extension torque increased significantly in the vibration exercise group (30.1 Nm/kg), but significantly more in the lumbar extension group (+59.2 Nm/kg; SEM 10.2; P < 0.05). No correlation was found between gain in lumbar torque and pain relief or pain-related disability (P > 0.2).  Conclusions: The current data indicate that poor lumbar muscle force probably is not the exclusive cause of chronic lower back pain. Different types of exercise therapy tend to yield comparable . Interestingly, well-controlled vibration may be the cure rather than the cause of lower back pain.\\\" MP:The aim of this multicenter trial was to compare the effects of whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) and whole-body vibration (WBV) with conventional back-strengthening training (CT) on changes in mean back pain intensity (MPI) and trunk strength in patients suffering from chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP). Two-hundred and forty CNLBP patients (40-70 years; 62% female) were randomly assigned to three intervention arms (WB-EMS: n = 80 vs. WBV: n = 80 vs. CT: n = 80). All training intervention programs were performed for 12 weeks in their usual commercial training setting. Before and during the last 4 weeks of the intervention, MPI was recorded using a 4-week pain diary. Additionally, maximal isometric trunk extension and -flexion strength was assessed on the BackCheck\\u00ae machine. A moderate but significant decrease of MPI was observed in all groups (WB-EMS: 29.7 \\u00b1 39.1% (SMD 0.50) vs. WBV: 30.3 \\u00b1 39.3% (SMD 0.57) vs. CT: 30.5 \\u00b1 39.6% (SMD 0.59); p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed for maximal isometric strength parameters with a significant increase in all groups (extension: WB-EMS: 17.1 \\u00b1 25.5% vs. WBV: 16.2 \\u00b1 23.6% vs. CT: 21.6 \\u00b1 27.5%; p < 0.001; flexion: WB-EMS: 13.3 \\u00b1 25.6% vs. WBV: 13.9 \\u00b1 24.0% vs. CT: 13.9 \\u00b1 25.4%; p < 0.001). No significant interaction effects for MPI (p = 0.920) and strength parameters (extension: p = 0.436; flexion: p = 0.937) were observed. WB-EMS, WBV, and CT are comparably effective in improving MPI and trunk strength. However, training volume of WB-EMS was 43 or 62% lower, compared with CT and WBV.  MP:   This study determined whether the combined application of sling exercises (SE) with targeted vibration and oscillations using a device called the Vibraoscillator (VO) is effective in reducing pain intensity, increasing range of motion (ROM), and enhancing back-related functions in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP).  Materials and  Thirty-six participants were randomized into experimental (SE + VO) and control (SE) groups. Both groups received the intervention twice a week for 4 weeks. The pain was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ROM was measured using the Modified-Modified Schober's Test (MMST), and the level of disability was evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Scale (ODI). In addition, the global perceived effect (GPE) was determined.   NRS and ODI scores significantly improved after the intervention in the experimental group. Only lumbar spine extension improved significantly in the case of ROM. The GPE satisfaction rate was 14.5% higher in the experimental group than in the control group.   Based on the findings obtained in this study, the combined use of VO and SE in patients with CNLBP was effective in reducing pain, improving ROM, and reducing physical disability in comparison with the treatment of only SE.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONChronic nonspecific low back pain is a major public health problem because it affects almost every person at least once in their lifetime.A new device called a Vibraoscillator generates horizontal vibrations and vertical oscillation movements targeted to a specific area of treatment to promote the neurofacilitation of the targeted zone, aiming for a more focused treatment than general vibrations.This device, in combination with sling exercises, is hypothesized to reduce pain and increase the mobility of the targeted zone and back-related functions in these patients.Based on our findings, the combined use of these interventions twice a week for 4 weeks was effective in reducing pain and improving the range of movement, which consequently reduced physical disability in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.\\\" MP:   The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) and core stabilization exercise (CSE) on pain, muscle strength, and functional recovery in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (NLBP).  Patients and  Between June 2016 and July 2017, a total of 74 patients with NLBP (12 males, 62 females; mean age: 44.7\\u00b18.9 years; range, 24 to 64 years) were included in this prospective, randomized-controlled study. The patients were randomly assigned to WBVE group (WBVEG, n=25), CSE group (CSEG, (n=25), and home exercise group as the control group (CG, (n=24). All groups performed 24 sessions of exercise for a total of eight weeks. Clinical outcome was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), computerized isokinetic muscle strengths (IMS) and progressive isoinertial lifting evaluation (PILE) test.   The VAS and RMDQ scores in WBVEG and CSEG statistically significantly decreased (p<0.05). The difference between the pre-treatment and at three-month VAS scores during intense activity were significantly different in both WBVEG and CSEG than the CG (p<0.05). The IMS values, except for the isokinetic flexion total work (IKFTW), increased significantly in all three groups (p<0.05). The IKFTW values increased significantly in the WBVEG and CSEG (p<0.05). A statistically significant increase in the functional work performance with PILE was observed in all three groups (p<0.05). The differences between the pre-treatment and three-month PILE test (ground to back and back to shoulder) were significantly different in both WBVEG and CSEG than the CG (p<0.05).   In the treatment of chronic NLBP, WBVE and CSE appear to be effective in pain and functionality. Although there was a significant improvement in muscle strength and functional work performance in all three groups, greater improvements were observed in the WBVEG and CSEG than the CG.\\\" MP:The goal of this randomized and controlled study was to examine whether whole-body vibration (WBV) training is able to reduce back pain and physical disability in seated working office employees with chronic low-back pain in a real-world setting. A total of 41 subjects (68.3% female/mean age 45.5\\u00b19.1 years/mean BMI 26.6\\u00b15.2) were randomly allocated to an intervention group (INT [n=21]) or a control group (CON [n=20]). The INT participated in WBV training 2.5 times per week for 3 months. The primary outcome was the change in the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire (RMQ) score over the study period. In addition, secondary outcomes included changes in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Work Ability Index Questionnaire, the quality of life questionnaire SF-36, the Freiburger activity questionnaire, and an isokinetic test of the musculature of the trunk. Compliance with the intervention in the INT reached a mean of 81.1%\\u00b131.2% with no long-lasting unwanted side effects. We found significant positive effects of 3 months of WBV training in the INT compared to the CON regarding the RMQ (P=.027), the ODI (P=.002), the SF-36 (P=.013), the Freiburger activity questionnaire (P=.022), the post-interventional sick-leave in the INT (P=.008), and trends regarding a positive effect of the intervention on the muscular capacity of the muscles of the trunk in flexion. WBV training seems to be an effective, safe, and suitable intervention for seated working employees with chronic low-back pain.  MP:There are many adolescent patients complaining of low back pain, but research on it is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of trunk stabilization exercise combined with vibration on the pain, proprioception, and kinematics of the lumbar spine (LS) during sit to stand (STS) in adolescent patients with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Fifty LBP patients were recruited and were randomly divided into two groups: Vibration group (n = 25) and placebo group (n = 25). All participants underwent 36-sessions of training consisting of six exercises. The Vibration group provided vibration stimulation during exercise, but the placebo group did not. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and digital dual inclinometer were used to measure pain intensity and proprioception. The kinematics of the lumbar spine during STS were measured by motion capture system. After training, the pain and proprioception in the vibration group improved significantly greater than the placebo group (p < 0.05). The mobility of LS (maximum range of motion, angular velocity, lumbar to hip movement ratios) and lumbar-hip coordination during STS in the vibration group were significantly improved compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Thus, trunk stabilization exercise combined with vibration may be used to improve the pain, proprioception, and kinematic of the lumbar spine during sit to stand in adolescent patients with LBP.  MP:   The aim of this study was to determine whether a 12-week course of low-frequency vibrating board therapy is a feasible therapy for non-specific chronic low back pain, and whether it improves the main outcome measures.   Randomized controlled trial.   A total of 50 patients with non-specific low back pain were included. They were randomly assigned to either a vibrating plate via reciprocation therapy group (n = 25) or a control group (n = 25).   The 12-week vibration therapy programme consisted of a total of 24 training sessions (2 times/week, with 1 day of rest between sessions). Assessments of the main outcome measures for non-specific low back pain were performed at baseline and at 12 weeks.   In the vibration therapy group there was a statistically significant improvement, of 20.37% (p = 0.031) in the Postural Stability Index (anterior-posterior); 25.15% (p = 0.013) in the Oswestry Index; 9.31% in the Roland Morris Index (p = 0.001); 8.57% (p = 0.042) in EuroQol 5D-3L; 20.29% (p = 0.002) in the Sens test; 24.13% (p = 0.006) in visual analogue scale back; and 16.58% (p = 0.008) in the Progressive Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation test.   A 12-week course of low-frequency vibrating board therapy is feasible and may represent a novel physical therapy for patients with non-specific low back pain.\\\" MP: As a local vibration therapy, deep muscle stimulation therapy can effectively relieve the pain and functional limitation caused by traction or fatigue, lactic acid accumulation, or fascia adhesion. However, less is reported on its effect on chronic non-specific low back pain.    To investigate the effect of deep muscle stimulation therapy on the changes of psoas surface electromyography as well as spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.   This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 102 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain admitted to Yancheng No. 1 People\\u2019s Hospital from February 2019 to June 2020 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups (n=51 per group): a control group and an observation group. Patients in the control group received a traditional lumbar stabilization exercise, and patients in the observation group received deep muscle stimulation therapy based on the lumbar stabilization exercise. Clinical efficacy, pain degree, lumbar spine function, psoas surface electromyography changes, spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters, quality of life, and adverse reactions were statistically analyzed before treatment, 1 and 6 months after treatment.    AND  The overall efficiency of the observation group (96%) was higher than that of the control group (82%; P < 0.05). After 1 and 6 months of treatment, the visual analog scale scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The maximal electromyographic value of the multifidus and musculi rotatores at 60\\u00b0 anteflexion, 90\\u00b0 abduction, and 45\\u00b0 extension was significantly higher in the observation group than the control group (P < 0.05). The step length symmetry index, foot deflection angle symmetry index, standing relative index, initial double support vertical ground reaction force, single support phase vertical ground reaction force, and terminal double support vertical ground reaction force were lower in the observation group than the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the Oswestry dysfunction index was lower (P < 0.05), and the SF-36 score was higher in the observation group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group and control group were 3.9% (2/51) and 5.9% (3/51), respectively, and there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). To conclude, deep muscle stimulation therapy can relieve pain, restore lumbar function and improve gait in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. \\\" MP: As a local vibration therapy, deep muscle stimulation therapy can relieve pain and loose fascia adhesion through a specific frequency of mechanical wave by hitting pain points, but less is reported on the changes of muscle tone and stiffness of erector spinaes after its effect on chronic non-specific low back pain.  To observe the effect of deep muscle stimulation on muscle tone and stiffness of erector spinaes as well as clinical efficacy in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain by a digital muscle detector.  A total of 60 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University from September 2019 to June 2021 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups (n=30 per group): a control group and an experimental group. Patients in the control group received the routine physical therapies, including core muscle group practice, stereodynamic interference electrotherapy and health education, and patients in the experimental group received deep muscle stimulation therapy based on the routine physical therapies, five times per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. Pain degree, waist function, changes of muscle tone and stiffness of the erector spinae muscle, and clinical efficacy were statistically analyzed before treatment, after the first treatment, after the completion of all treatments, and 4 weeks after treatment.   AND  After the first treatment, the oscillation frequency (F value), visual analog scale scores and stiffness values of the two groups were significantly lowered (P < 0.05), except for the oscillation frequency of the control group (P > 0.05). After the completion of all treatments, the visual analog scale scores, oscillation frequency, dynamic stiffness, and Quebec Baclain Disability Scale scores of the two groups were significantly lower than before treatment (P < 0.05), while the experimental group was better than the control group (P < 0.05). Four weeks after treatment, the Quebec baclain disability scale scores of two groups were improved compared with those after the completion of all treatments (P < 0.05), and the Quebec baclain disability scale score in the control group was significantly improved compared with that in the experimental group (P < 0.05). The number of effective and total effective cases in the experimental group were both better than those in the control group (P < 0.05) after the completion of all treatments. The overall efficiency of the experimental group (97%) was higher than that of the control group (80%; P < 0.05). Four weeks after treatment, the number of effective and total effective cases in the experimental group were also better than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The overall efficiency of the control group (63%) was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Although the overall efficiency of the experimental group (93%) decreased (P < 0.05), the clinical efficacy was mainly maintained. To conclude, deep muscle stimulation with routine physical therapies can effectively relieve pain, reduce muscle tone and stiffness of erector spinaes, and improve and keep the clinical efficacy in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. \\\"           \",\n          \"MP:The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk of heart disease in individuals who underwent cholecystectomy. This was a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Service database of South Korea. A total of 146,928 patients who underwent cholecystectomy and 268,502 age- and sex-matched controls were compared. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for heart disease after cholecystectomy. In , a previous history of cholecystectomy increased the risk of heart disease (congestive heart failure [CHF], myocardial infarction [MI], atrial fibrillation [AF]) (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.40, 95% CI: [1.36-1.44]). The increased risk was particularly seen for CHF (1.22 [1.16-1.29]) but not for MI and AF (p > 0.05). In the subgroup analyses, cholecystectomy was associated with an increased risk of MI in patients aged <65 years (1.49 [1.16-1.92] and 1.18 [1.05-1.35] in patients aged 40-49 and 50-64 years, respectively), but not in those aged \\u2265 65 years (0.932 [0.838-1.037]). Moreover, the risk of MI was increased in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) (1.16 [1.06-1.27]); however, it was decreased in patients with DM (0.83 [0.72-0.97]). In contrast, cholecystectomy did not modify the risk of AF in the subgroup analyses (all p > 0.05). In conclusion, a history of cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of CHF. Cholecystectomy may increase the risk of MI in the younger population without DM. These findings suggest that the alteration of bile metabolism and homeostasis might be potentially associated with the development of some heart diseases. MP:Knowledge about temporal associations for screen-detected gallstone disease and cardiovascular disease is limited. The objective of this study was to determine if screen-detected gallstones or cholecystectomy was associated with development of cardiovascular disease. A cohort study of three randomly selected groups from the general population of Copenhagen was performed. Participants (n = 5928) were examined 1982-1992 and underwent abdominal ultrasound examination to detect gallstone disease and were not informed of their gallstone status. Participants were followed up for occurrence of cardiovascular disease through nationwide registers until December 2014. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed including traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors and apolipoprotein E genotype. Gallstone disease was identified in 10% (591/5928) of participants at baseline of whom 6.8% had gallstones and 3.2% had cholecystectomy. The study population was followed for a period of 32 years with only 1% lost to follow-up. Gallstone disease was associated with all cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio (HR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.17;1.59]) and to the subgroups coronary artery (HR 1.34, 95% CI [1.10;1.64]), cerebrovascular (HR 1.22, 95% CI [0.97;1.52]), and peripheral artery disease (HR 1.57, 95% CI [1.15;2.13]). No differences in estimates were identified for gallstones detected at ultrasound or cholecystectomy. Adjustment did not change estimates substantially. Gallstone disease seems to be independently associated to cardiovascular disease. Associations cannot be explained through traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, apolipoprotein E4 allele, or detection bias. Future studies should explore the link between gallstone and cardiovascular disease further and gut microbiota may be a candidate mechanism.  MP:   Gallstone disease has been related to cardiovascular risk factors; however, whether presence of gallstones predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well established.  Approach and  We followed up 269 142 participants who were free of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline from 3 US cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (112 520 women; 1980-2010), Nurses' Health Study II (112 919 women; 1989-2011), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (43 703 men; 1986-2010) and documented 21 265 incident CHD cases. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio for the participants with a history of gallstone disease compared with those without was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.21) in Nurses' Health Study, 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.51) in Nurses' Health Study II, and 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.20) in Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The associations seemed to be stronger in individuals who were not obese, not diabetic, or were normotensive, compared with their counterparts. We identified 4 published prospective studies by searching PUBMED and EMBASE up to October 2015, coupled with our 3 cohorts, involving 842 553 participants and 51 123 incident CHD cases. The  from meta-analysis revealed that a history of gallstone disease was associated with a 23% (15%-33%) increased CHD risk.   Our findings support that a history of gallstone disease is associated with increased CHD risk, independently of traditional risk factors.\\\" MP:   Gallstones are common disorders associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Gallstone formation and atherosclerosis may share key pathways, but studies on putative associations between gallstones and the risk of cardiovascular disease are sparse and non-conclusive. We studied the relationship between gallstones and the risk of subsequent cardiovascular diseases in the German arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).   The study comprises 46,468 participants from EPIC-Potsdam and EPIC-Heidelberg aged 35-65 years, free of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at baseline. Information about the gallstone status at baseline was ascertained via questionnaires. For all incident cases of myocardial infarction and stroke confirmation was obtained from the treating physician. Relative risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.   During eight years of follow-up, 919 participants suffered a stroke or myocardial infarction. After multivariable adjustment for established risk factors, subjects with reported gallstones (n = 4828) had an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (hazard rate ratio (HR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.50). In individuals, who underwent a cholecystectomy before baseline a 1.32-fold increase in risk was observed (95%CI: 1.05, 1.65). HRs differed depending on the presence of selected established risk factors (e.g. HR for cardiovascular diseases regarding gallstones in smokers = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.20, 2.30, and non-smokers = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.86, 1.38).  Conclusions: Our  indicate an increased cardiovascular risk for gallstone formers, which cannot be counteracted by gallbladder removal and opens up perspectives for individualized prevention strategies.\\\" MP:   Gallstone disease (GSD) is related to multiple cardiovascular risk factors; the present study was to prospectively examine the association between GSD and ischemic heart disease (IHD).  Approach and  We examined the association of GSD with IHD among 199 292 men and 288 081 women aged 30-79 years in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke at baseline were excluded. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the association of GSD with IHD. The prevalence of self-reported GSD was 3.7% in men and 7.3% in women at baseline. During 3 431 124 person-years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median, 7.2 years), we documented 10 245 incident IHD cases in men and 14 714 in women. As compared with men without GSD at baseline, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for IHD was 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22) for men with GSD; the respective hazard ratio was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.34) in women and 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.28) in the whole cohort. The sex difference in IHD risk associated with GSD was statistically significant (P=0.009 for interaction with sex). In addition, we found that the association between GSD and IHD was stronger in nonhypertensive than in hypertensive women (P<0.001 for interaction).  Conclusions: In this large prospective study, the presence of GSD was associated with an increased risk of incident IHD, independent of other risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Our findings suggest novel prevention strategy to mitigate heart disease through improvement of gastrointestinal health.\\\" MP:  Background and  Gallstones and stroke are common diseases worldwide. The relationship between gallstones and stroke has been documented in the literature. In this work, to characterize the risk of stroke among gallstone patients with and without cholecystectomy, we investigated the effects of cholecystectomy in a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study.   Data were obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The study comprised 155 356 gallstone patients divided into two groups: those with and without cholecystectomy.   During the study period (2000-2012), 19 096 (17.8/1000 person-years) gallstone patients without cholecystectomy and 11 913 (10.6/1000 person-years) gallstone patients with cholecystectomy had a stroke. Following gallstone removal, the patients exhibited a significant decrease in the risk of overall stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-0.61), ischemic stroke (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.58-0.61), and hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.53-0.59). Asymptomatic and symptomatic gallstone patients had lower overall stroke risk after cholecystectomy (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.62-0.67 and HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.56-0.59) than did asymptomatic gallstone patients without cholecystectomy.  Conclusions: This population-based cohort study demonstrated that cholecystectomy is related to reduce the risk of overall stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. Preventive measures for stroke may be considered for gallstone patients, particularly those presenting risk factor(s) for stroke.\\\" MP:Objective  To investigate whether gallstone disease (GD) increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a large population-based cohort. Methods  A study population including 6,981 patients with GD was identified from The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2004 and 2005. GD patients were defined as patients with principal discharge diagnoses of cholelithiasis using the ICD-9-CM code 574. 27,924 patients without GD were randomly selected and matched for age and gender. All patients were followed for 6 years or until diagnosis for CVD. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the risk of developing CVD with adjustment for age, gender and co-morbid conditions.   During the six years follow-up period, 935 patients with GD and 2,758 patients without GD developed CVD. Patients with GD had an elevated risk of CVD (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.22-1.43) when compared with those without GD. Similar relationship was observed when CVD was categorized i.e. stroke (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32), coronary heart disease (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28-1.58) and heart failure (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.00-1.73). When GD was classified according to the level of severity, using patients without GD as reference, the risks of CVD were elevated in patients with non-severe GD (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24-1.46) as well as those with severe GD (HR, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.02-1.40), after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. In age-stratified analysis, patients aged 18-40 years with GD were at higher risk of developing CVD (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.84) than older GD patients. Conclusion  This study found an increased risk of CVD in patients diagnosed with GD. The excess risk was particularly high in younger GD patients. Prevention of GD could help reduce the risk of developing CVD, and the better effect could be achieved for the younger age groups.\\\" MP:A relationship between cholesterol gallstone disease and atherosclerosis or its sequellae has long been postulated but has never been adequately proven. Data for this investigation of the relationship of diagnosed cholesterol cholelithiasis to subsequent incident coronary heart disease were obtained from a review of the pre-existing prospectively collected medical records of the 5,209 individuals followed since 1952 as members of the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. Preliminary univariate examination of these data, making no correction for time ordering of the conditions or for shared risk factors, indicated a significant modest positive association in men but no relationship in women. Logistic multiple regression analyses, allowing for the effects of time ordering and for eight standard coronary disease risk factors, confirmed these findings. The authors speculate that the presence of cholesterol gallstones in male patients may be indicative of an unfavorable lipoprotein profile. These  have clinical implications in that male gallstone patients are at increased risk for subsequent coronary disease and should be monitored accordingly. This investigation marks the first time that a relationship between these conditions has been established using a longitudinal cohort study approach. \",\n          \"MP:Background Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been associated with aortic dissection (AD), but the magnitude of this association and its independence from confounders have not yet been established.  Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in 82 patients with Stanford's Type B AD and 116 controls from May 2009 to October 2012. A sleep study was performed in both groups using a modified Berlin questionnaire and polysomnography. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with AD. A third study in controls with OSAS but without AD was performed to prospectively assess the incidence of AD onset during follow-up. Cases and controls were matched for confounding factors.  Conclusions OSAS is highly prevalent and independently associated with Stanford's Type B AD. OSAS comorbidity should be considered in patients with clinically silent AD. Therapeutic strategy for patient with coexisting AD and OSAS such as continuous positive airway pressure and beta blockers needs to be evaluated.  Results Cases had significantly higher Berlin scores than controls (75.6% vs. 54.3% high risk, P = 0.002). OSAS frequency was 81.7% among patients and 67.2% among controls (P = 0.024). Patients with Stanford's Type B AD had higher apneas-hypopneas index (17.4 vs. 7.0 events/hr, P = 0.001) and mean 4% oxygen desaturation index (16 vs. 7 events/hr, P = 0.005) and a lower SaO2 during sleep (average 87% vs. 93%, P = 0.005) than controls. In a logistic regression model, OSAS was independently associated with Stanford's Type B AD (odds ratio 1.063, 95% confidence interval: 1.010-1.120; P = 0.020). Two patients developed AD during the prospective study. Both patients had serious OSAS and high Berlin risk, respectively. In addition, patients with coexisting AD and OSAS were significantly younger.  MP:Background Sleep apnea (SA) was associated with increased prevalence of aortic dissection (AD) in studies that were criticized for either their small sample size or lack of prospective observation. Using a considerably larger nationwide, population-based database and a long-term prospective cohort design, our study strived to explore the relationship between SA and the subsequent development of AD. Methods From 2000 to 2007, we gathered a study cohort consisting of 15,848 newly diagnosed cases of SA from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. For the control group, another 39,826 individuals without SA were matched for age, sex, and comorbidity. The two cohorts were followed-up to observe the occurrence of AD. Results During an average 3.59 \\u00b1 2.41 years of follow-up, we observed 33 cases of new AD occurrence [non-SA (22, 0.1%) vs. SA (11, 0.1%), p = 0.669], and the incidence of AD was similar for both groups. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity, only age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01\\u20131.06; p = 0.006], male gender (HR 2.49; 95% CI, 1.07\\u20135.79; p = 0.034), and hypertension (HR 6.28; 95% CI, 2.36\\u201316.67; p < 0.001) were independently associated with AD diagnosis. Conclusion SA was not associated with an increased risk of AD using a large nationwide cohort database. Nonetheless, larger prospective studies or meta-analyses are recommended to confirm our findings.   MP:Background Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been associated with aortic dissection (AD), but the magnitude of this association and its independence from confounders have not yet been established.

In addition, patients with coexisting AD and OSAS were significantly younger.  MP:Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a process that is associated with the development of arterial hypertension, the main risk factor for aortic dissection and during obstructive episodes of the upper airways with marked increases in transmural pressure of the aorta wall. The aim of this work was to study the association between aortic dissection and OSAS. Nineteen consecutive patients with thoracic aorta dissection and 19 hypertensive patients of similar age, sex, and body mass index were studied by clinical questionnaire and polysomnography. Snoring and nonrefreshing sleep were common in both groups. Thirteen patients (68%) from each group showed an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 5 per hour. However, patients with aortic dissection presented a higher apnea-hypopnea index (28 [30.3] versus 11.1 [10.4], p = 0.032). Seven patients with dissection presented an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 30 versus 1 patient in the control group (p = 0.042). Patients with thoracic aorta dissection presented a high prevalence of previously undiagnosed and frequently severe OSAS. Further studies, including this diagnosis as a prognostic variable in the follow-up of patients with aortic dissection, are required. Our results suggest that in patients with aortic dissection and symptoms consistent with OSAS, a sleep study should be considered in their clinical management.  MP:Background: The pathogenesis and etiology of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are largely unknown. Preliminary data from patients with aortic dissection and abdominal aneurysms suggest a causal link of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on aortic disease. Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of OSA in patients with TAA compared to a matched control group. Method: In this prospective parallel-cohort study, we 2-to-1 matched 208 patients with verified TAA (at the aortic sinus and/or ascending aorta) to 104 controls without TAA according to sex, age, height, weight, and left ventricular ejection fraction. All participants underwent an ultrasound of the thoracic aorta and a level III respiratory polygraphy. OSA was defined as apnea-hypopnea index \\u22655/h. The prevalence of OSA was compared with conditional logistic regression and controlling for the matching variables. Results: A total of 312 patients (mean age 65 \\u00b1 11 years, 82% male, mean body mass index 27 \\u00b1 4 kg/m2) were successfully 2-to-1 matched in the final model. Prevalence of OSA was significantly higher in the TAA-group when compared to the matched control group (63 vs. 47%; odds ratio 1.87 [95% CI 1.05-3.34]; p = 0.03). When applying a higher apnea-hypopnea index threshold (\\u226515/h), the odds ratio increased to 3.25 (95% CI 1.65-6.42; p < 0.001). The median apnea-hypopnea index was higher in patients with TAA (9.2/h [3.3-20.0] vs. 4.5/h [2.2-11.1], p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with TAA have a higher prevalence of OSA when compared to the general population. Since OSA is effectively treatable and might contribute to the pathogenesis of TAA, further longitudinal trials are needed to assess the association between OSA and TAA.  MP:Objective: To investigate cardiac structural changes in elderly patients with obstructive sleep apnoeahypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) and the impact on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Methods: The study enrolled elderly patients with OSAHS and age-matched healthy control subjects. Cardiac structure, left ventricular diastolic function and left ventricular systolic function were measured using a Doppler ultrasound scanner and compared between the two groups. Results: The study included 136 patients with OSAHS and 50 healthy control subjects. There were significant differences in the echocardiography indicators that reflect cardiac structure, including interventricular septum, left ventricle posterior wall thickness, and left ventricular mass and mass index between the two groups. There were significant differences between the two groups in the ventricular septal early diastolic myocardial peak velocity/late diastolic myocardial peak velocity (Em/Am), mitral annulus Em/Am, and left ventricle posterior wall Em/Am. There were also significant differences in the indicators of interventricular septum, mitral annulus and left ventricular posterior wall systolic peak velocity between the two groups. Conclusion: Elderly patients with OSAHS demonstrated cardiac structural changes and their left ventricular diastolic and systolic functions were significantly diminished.   MP:Background: Structural and functional properties of the proximal thoracic aorta have important implications in clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with proximal aortic size and aortic stiffness in a multi-ethnic community-based cohort. Methods: The sample included the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep Ancillary study participants without known CVD who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The main exposure variable was OSA severity based on the polysomnography-derived apnea hypopnea index (AHI; normal, AHI <5/h; mild, 5\\u2264 AHI <15/h; moderate to severe, AHI \\u226515/h). The study outcomes were ascending aortic diameter (AoD, cm), aortic pulse wave velocity (AoPWV, m/s), and ascending aortic distensibility (AAD, %/mm Hg). Analyses were performed in the overall sample and in sex-specific strata, adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Results: The 708 participants were 55.9% female and on average 68 years old (54-93 years). There was a significant trend (p < 0.0001) of greater mean (SD) AoD across the three OSA groups: normal (n = 87), 3.13 cm (0.35); mild (n = 215), 3.25 (0.34); moderate to severe (n = 406), 3.37 (0.36). In adjusted analysis, participants with moderate to severe OSA had a greater mean AoD compared with the normal group: adjusted mean difference (95% CI), 0.12 cm (0.05, 0.20), p = 0.002. This AoD gradient was observed in women but not in men (p for interaction = 0.02). No differences were found in AoPWV or AAD among the OSA groups. Conclusion: In a diverse community-based cohort, moderate to severe OSA (vs. no OSA) was associated with a larger ascending AoD in women.  MP:Purpose This study aims to assess changes in cardiac imageology of patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without cardiovascular disease. Methods All enrolled participants underwent polysomnography (PSG). Some participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography, speckle tracking echocardiography, and cardiac-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if they were willing. They were divided into three groups according to PSG results: non-OSA, mild OSA, and moderate-to-severe OSA. Imageology parameters were compared, and the relationship between OSA severity and imageology indices was analyzed by correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. Results Of the 352 enrolled participants, 274 participants with OSA had an apnea\\u2013hypopnea index (AHI) of\\u2009\\u2265\\u20095 (86 mild OSA and 188 moderate-to-severe OSA cases), and 78 participants with non-OSA had an AHI of\\u2009<\\u20095. Transthoracic echocardiography showed that E/A and E\\u2019/A\\u2019 values were lower in the mild OSA group than in the non-OSA group (1.12\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.37 vs 1.27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.45 and 0.83\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.33 vs 0.99\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.42, respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The aorta and ascending aorta widths were smaller in the mild OSA group than in the moderate-and-severe OSA groups (27.36\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.87 mm vs 28.87\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.95 mm and 30.27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.79 mm vs 31.63\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.74 mm, respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). A regression analysis showed that cardiac function changes in patients with OSA may be related to age, obesity, and OSA severity. Conclusion Patients with mild OSA without cardiovascular disease displayed changes in cardiac structure and function on transthoracic echocardiography.  MP:Background: Recent studies suggest that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes thoracic aortic dilatation; but it is well accepted that hypertension can cause aortic dilatation, and hypertension is a common finding in patients with OSA. We aimed to investigate the relative impact of OSA and hypertension on the structural and functional changes of the thoracic aorta. Methods: This was an echocardiography substudy of our prospective OSA study in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Ninety-four male patients who completed both echocardiography and polysomnography were recruited. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \\u2265 15/hour. Results: The patients' mean age was 53 \\u00b1 10 years, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.6 \\u00b1 3kg/m 2. Sixty-four (68.1%) patients had OSA; of these, 39 (41.5%) had severe OSA. Thirty-three (52.6%) of the OSA cohort had hypertension. There was no correlation between any of the echocardiographic parameters and thoracic aortic size. Stepwise multivariate regression showed that BMI (P = 0.024), older age (P = 0.044), and hypertension (P = 0.025) were the only determinants. There was no significant independent relationship between OSA/ AHI and thoracic aortic size. Systolic blood pressure but not AHI correlated significantly with aortic distensibility and compliance (r = -0.40 and -0.26, P < 0.001 and 0.022, respectively). Conclusions: Hypertension is a common finding in male AMI patients with OSA. In these patients, increased afterload from systemic hypertension rather than mechanical stress on the aortic wall determines the thoracic aortic size and abnormalities in aortic functional indices. BMI and age were also independent predictors of thoracic aortic dilatation.  MP:Study Objective Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been considered to be an important predisposing factor for cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the impact of OSAS on cardiac function and remodeling in patients without congestive heart failure. Methods A total of 79 patients with sleep disordered breathing, preserved systolic function, and normal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level were enrolled. Sixty-five patients were classified to have moderate to severe OSAS (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] \\u2265 15/h), while the other 14 patients with mild or no OSAS (AHI < 15/h) served as control subjects. Baseline clinical and polysomnographic variables as well as tissue Doppler imaging and three-dimensional echocardiographic parameters were obtained. Results The body mass index, neck circumference, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, desaturation index, arousal index, and snoring index were significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe OSAS than those without (p < 0.05). The left atrial size, mitral A-wave velocity, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were significantly larger, while E/A ratio was lower in patients with moderate to severe OSAS than those without (p < 0.05). Notably, AHI in REM sleep was significantly correlated with the aortic root size, E/A ratio, left ventricular volume, and stroke volume. In addition, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for AHI in REM sleep \\u2265 32.3/h was 0.647 (95% CI [0.525, 0.769]) in predicting the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. AHI in REM sleep \\u2265 32.3/h was the only independent variant in predicting diastolic dysfunction after adjusting the variables including age, gender, hypertension, and body mass index. Conclusions Patients with moderate to severe OSAS tend to have cardiac dysfunction revealed by echocardiography. High AHI in REM sleep is significantly associated with cardiovascular remodeling and ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and may be a potential variable to predict cardiac dysfunction.

However, the potential of tDCS to enhance sport-specific motor performance in athletes remains elusive. Objective  We aimed at analyzing the acute effects of a single anodal tDCS session on sport-specific motor performance changes in athletes compared to sham. Methods  A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The meta-analysis was performed using an inverse variance method and a random-effects model. Additionally, two subgroup analyses were conducted (1) depending on the stimulated brain areas (primary motor cortex (M1), temporal cortex (TC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CB)), and (2) studies clustered in subgroups according to different sports performance domains (endurance, strength, visuomotor skill). Results  A total number of 19 studies enrolling a sample size of 258 athletes were deemed eligible for inclusion. Across all included studies, a significant moderate standardized mean difference (SMD) favoring anodal tDCS to enhance sport-specific motor performance could be observed. Subgroup analysis depending on cortical target areas of tDCS indicated a significant moderate SMD in favor of anodal tDCS compared to sham for M1 stimulation. Conclusion  A single anodal tDCS session can lead to performance enhancement in athletes in sport-specific motor tasks. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the modes of action as a function of performance domain or stimulation site, these results imply intriguing possibilities concerning sports performance enhancement through anodal M1 stimulation.\",\n          \"The effect of stress on Graves' disease (GD) is controversial. Our purpose was to quantify the impacts of stress on patients with Graves' disease.   Systematic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsycInfo were conducted from inception to 1 January 2023. Studies comparing the incidence of stressful life events (SLEs) that occurred before diagnosis and during drug therapy in cases diagnosed with GD and controls were included in the final analysis.  : Nine case-control studies and four cohort studies enrolling 2892 participants (1685 [58%] patients) were included. Meta-analysis revealed a high and significant effect-size index in a random effect model (d = 1.81, P = 0.01), indicating that stress is an important factor in the onset of GD. The relationship between SLEs and GD was stronger in studies with higher proportions of female patients (\\u03b2 = 0.22, P < 0.01) and weaker in studies with older patients with GD (\\u03b2 =-0.62, P < 0.01). However, stress did not significantly affect the outcome of antithyroid drug therapy for GD (d = 0.32, P = 0.09).  Conclusions: The  of this meta-analysis suggest that stress is one of the environmental triggers for the onset of GD. Therefore, we recommend stress management assistance for individuals genetically susceptible to GD, especially for young females.\",\n          \"Novel disease-specific and mechanism-based treatments sharing good evidence of efficacy for migraine have been recently marketed. However, rembursement by insurers depends on treatment failure with classic anti-migraine drugs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify and rate the evidence for efficacy of flunarizine, a repurposed, first- or second-line treatment for migraine prophylaxis.   A systematic search in MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed for trials of pharmacological treatment in migraine prophylaxis, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). Eligible trials for meta-analysis were randomized, placebo-controlled studies comparing flunarizine with placebo. Outcomes of interest according to the Outcome Set for preventive intervention trials in chronic and episodic migraine (COSMIG) were the proportion of patients reaching a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, the change in monthly migraine days (MMDs), and Adverse Events (AEs) leading to discontinuation.  : Five trials were eligible for narrative description and three for data synthesis and analysis. No studies reported the predefined outcomes, but one study assessed the 50% reduction in monthly migraine attacks with flunarizine as compared to placebo showing a benefit from flunarizine with a low or probably low risk of bias. We found that flunarizine may increase the proportion of patients who discontinue due to adverse events compared to placebo (risk difference: 0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06).  Conclusions: Published flunarizine trials predate the recommended endpoints for evaluating migraine prophylaxis drugs, hence the lack of an adequate assessment for these endpoints. Further, modern-day, large-scale studies would be valuable in re-evaluating the efficacy of flunarizine for the treatment of migraines, offering additional insights into its potential benefits.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Meta_Paper\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 400,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MP:[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of whole body vibration (WBV) on static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and the disability of patients with chronic lower back pain. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were of 40 patients, who were randomly assigned to WBV and control groups. Twenty-five minutes of lumbar stability training and 5 minutes of WBV were conducted for the WBV group, and 30 minutes of lumbar stability training was conducted for the control group. The training was conducted three times per week for a total of 6 weeks. Static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and disability were measured before and after the intervention. [] After the intervention, the WBV group showed a significant differences in static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and disability. The control group presented significant differences in pain, and disability. In the comparison of the two groups, the WBV group showed more significant improvements in the fall index and pain. [Conclusion] WBV can be recommended for the improvement of the balance ability and pain of chronic lower back pain patients.  MP:   This 2-step prospective randomized parallel trial evaluated postural stability in 65 back pain participants (61.6\\u00b17.9 y) and 50 nonback pain participants (61.2\\u00b18.6 y) in a first step using the MFT-S3-Check. In a second step, postural stability and questionnaires were evaluated in back pain participants before and after therapy with either whole body vibration therapy or classic physiotherapy.   The first aim was to investigate whether the MFT-S3-Check is suitable to evaluate differences in postural stability in back pain and nonback pain participants. The second aim was to evaluate the effect of whole body vibration therapy and classic physiotherapy on postural stability and the influence of depressive symptoms and pain.  Objective bodily measurement values in chronic back pain are rare; therefore, the evaluation of effectiveness of different therapies is difficult.   Postural stability was investigated using stability-, sensorimotor-, and symmetry indexes, in standing and seated positions with the MFT-S3-Check. The following standard questionnaires were used to investigate pain and depressive symptoms: HADS, ODI, NASS, SF-36.   No significant difference in postural stability was found between back pain participants and the nonback pain group. None of the two training concepts in back pain participants was superior, concerning postural stability and pain. Both treatments showed positive effects, with significant improvements in postural stability in the classic physiotherapy group. Depressive symptoms had a significant correlation with pain intensity in back pain participants.  Conclusions: The MFT-S3-Check could not find a significant difference in postural stability between the back pain and nonback pain group in the study setting. Postural stability improved after treatment.\\\" MP:   To confirm the benefits of whole-body vibration exercise for pain intensity and functional disability in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.   Single-blind randomized controlled trial.   Outpatient.   Eighty-nine patients with non-specific chronic low back pain met the inclusion criteria, they were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (n = 45) or the control group (n = 44).  Intervention: The intervention group received whole-body vibration exercises three times a week for 12 weeks. The control group received general exercise protocol three times a week for 12 weeks.  Main outcomes: The primary outcome measures were pain intensity and functional disability measured by the visual analog scale scores and Oswestry Disability Index. The secondary outcome measures included lumbar joint position sense, quality of life (Short Form Health Survey 36) and overall treatment effect (Global Perceived Effect).   A total of 84 subjects completed the 12-week study program. After 12 weeks, compared with the control group, the mean visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased by additional 1 point (95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.22 to -0.78; P < 0.001), 3.81 point (95% CI, -4.98, -2.63; P < 0.001) based on adjusted analysis in the intervention group. And the intervention group provided additional beneficial effects for in terms of lumbar joint position sense (P < 0.05), quality of life (P < 0.05), and Global Perceived Effect (P = 0.012).   The study demonstrated that whole-body vibration exercise could provide more benefits than general exercise for relieving pain and improving functional disability in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.\\\" MP:   A randomized controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up period was conducted.   To compare lumbar extension exercise and whole-body vibration exercise for chronic lower back pain.  Chronic lower back pain involves muscular as well as connective and neural systems. Different types of physiotherapy are applied for its treatment. Industrial vibration is regarded as a risk factor. Recently, vibration exercise has been developed as a new type of physiotherapy. It is thought to activate muscles via reflexes.   In this study, 60 patients with chronic lower back pain devoid of \\\"\\\"specific\\\"\\\" spine diseases, who had a mean age of 51.7 years and a pain history of 13.1 years, practiced either isodynamic lumbar extension or vibration exercise for 3 months. Outcome measures were lumbar extension torque, pain sensation (visual analog scale), and pain-related disability (pain disability index).   A significant and comparable reduction in pain sensation and pain-related disability was observed in both groups. Lumbar extension torque increased significantly in the vibration exercise group (30.1 Nm/kg), but significantly more in the lumbar extension group (+59.2 Nm/kg; SEM 10.2; P < 0.05). No correlation was found between gain in lumbar torque and pain relief or pain-related disability (P > 0.2).  Conclusions: The current data indicate that poor lumbar muscle force probably is not the exclusive cause of chronic lower back pain. Different types of exercise therapy tend to yield comparable . Interestingly, well-controlled vibration may be the cure rather than the cause of lower back pain.\\\" MP:The aim of this multicenter trial was to compare the effects of whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) and whole-body vibration (WBV) with conventional back-strengthening training (CT) on changes in mean back pain intensity (MPI) and trunk strength in patients suffering from chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP). Two-hundred and forty CNLBP patients (40-70 years; 62% female) were randomly assigned to three intervention arms (WB-EMS: n = 80 vs. WBV: n = 80 vs. CT: n = 80). All training intervention programs were performed for 12 weeks in their usual commercial training setting. Before and during the last 4 weeks of the intervention, MPI was recorded using a 4-week pain diary. Additionally, maximal isometric trunk extension and -flexion strength was assessed on the BackCheck\\u00ae machine. A moderate but significant decrease of MPI was observed in all groups (WB-EMS: 29.7 \\u00b1 39.1% (SMD 0.50) vs. WBV: 30.3 \\u00b1 39.3% (SMD 0.57) vs. CT: 30.5 \\u00b1 39.6% (SMD 0.59); p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed for maximal isometric strength parameters with a significant increase in all groups (extension: WB-EMS: 17.1 \\u00b1 25.5% vs. WBV: 16.2 \\u00b1 23.6% vs. CT: 21.6 \\u00b1 27.5%; p < 0.001; flexion: WB-EMS: 13.3 \\u00b1 25.6% vs. WBV: 13.9 \\u00b1 24.0% vs. CT: 13.9 \\u00b1 25.4%; p < 0.001). No significant interaction effects for MPI (p = 0.920) and strength parameters (extension: p = 0.436; flexion: p = 0.937) were observed. WB-EMS, WBV, and CT are comparably effective in improving MPI and trunk strength. However, training volume of WB-EMS was 43 or 62% lower, compared with CT and WBV.  MP:   This study determined whether the combined application of sling exercises (SE) with targeted vibration and oscillations using a device called the Vibraoscillator (VO) is effective in reducing pain intensity, increasing range of motion (ROM), and enhancing back-related functions in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP).  Materials and  Thirty-six participants were randomized into experimental (SE + VO) and control (SE) groups. Both groups received the intervention twice a week for 4 weeks. The pain was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ROM was measured using the Modified-Modified Schober's Test (MMST), and the level of disability was evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Scale (ODI). In addition, the global perceived effect (GPE) was determined.   NRS and ODI scores significantly improved after the intervention in the experimental group. Only lumbar spine extension improved significantly in the case of ROM. The GPE satisfaction rate was 14.5% higher in the experimental group than in the control group.   Based on the findings obtained in this study, the combined use of VO and SE in patients with CNLBP was effective in reducing pain, improving ROM, and reducing physical disability in comparison with the treatment of only SE.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONChronic nonspecific low back pain is a major public health problem because it affects almost every person at least once in their lifetime.A new device called a Vibraoscillator generates horizontal vibrations and vertical oscillation movements targeted to a specific area of treatment to promote the neurofacilitation of the targeted zone, aiming for a more focused treatment than general vibrations.This device, in combination with sling exercises, is hypothesized to reduce pain and increase the mobility of the targeted zone and back-related functions in these patients.Based on our findings, the combined use of these interventions twice a week for 4 weeks was effective in reducing pain and improving the range of movement, which consequently reduced physical disability in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.\\\" MP:   The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) and core stabilization exercise (CSE) on pain, muscle strength, and functional recovery in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (NLBP).  Patients and  Between June 2016 and July 2017, a total of 74 patients with NLBP (12 males, 62 females; mean age: 44.7\\u00b18.9 years; range, 24 to 64 years) were included in this prospective, randomized-controlled study. The patients were randomly assigned to WBVE group (WBVEG, n=25), CSE group (CSEG, (n=25), and home exercise group as the control group (CG, (n=24). All groups performed 24 sessions of exercise for a total of eight weeks. Clinical outcome was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), computerized isokinetic muscle strengths (IMS) and progressive isoinertial lifting evaluation (PILE) test.   The VAS and RMDQ scores in WBVEG and CSEG statistically significantly decreased (p<0.05). The difference between the pre-treatment and at three-month VAS scores during intense activity were significantly different in both WBVEG and CSEG than the CG (p<0.05). The IMS values, except for the isokinetic flexion total work (IKFTW), increased significantly in all three groups (p<0.05). The IKFTW values increased significantly in the WBVEG and CSEG (p<0.05). A statistically significant increase in the functional work performance with PILE was observed in all three groups (p<0.05). The differences between the pre-treatment and three-month PILE test (ground to back and back to shoulder) were significantly different in both WBVEG and CSEG than the CG (p<0.05).   In the treatment of chronic NLBP, WBVE and CSE appear to be effective in pain and functionality. Although there was a significant improvement in muscle strength and functional work performance in all three groups, greater improvements were observed in the WBVEG and CSEG than the CG.\\\" MP:The goal of this randomized and controlled study was to examine whether whole-body vibration (WBV) training is able to reduce back pain and physical disability in seated working office employees with chronic low-back pain in a real-world setting. A total of 41 subjects (68.3% female/mean age 45.5\\u00b19.1 years/mean BMI 26.6\\u00b15.2) were randomly allocated to an intervention group (INT [n=21]) or a control group (CON [n=20]). The INT participated in WBV training 2.5 times per week for 3 months. The primary outcome was the change in the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire (RMQ) score over the study period. In addition, secondary outcomes included changes in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Work Ability Index Questionnaire, the quality of life questionnaire SF-36, the Freiburger activity questionnaire, and an isokinetic test of the musculature of the trunk. Compliance with the intervention in the INT reached a mean of 81.1%\\u00b131.2% with no long-lasting unwanted side effects. We found significant positive effects of 3 months of WBV training in the INT compared to the CON regarding the RMQ (P=.027), the ODI (P=.002), the SF-36 (P=.013), the Freiburger activity questionnaire (P=.022), the post-interventional sick-leave in the INT (P=.008), and trends regarding a positive effect of the intervention on the muscular capacity of the muscles of the trunk in flexion. WBV training seems to be an effective, safe, and suitable intervention for seated working employees with chronic low-back pain.  MP:There are many adolescent patients complaining of low back pain, but research on it is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of trunk stabilization exercise combined with vibration on the pain, proprioception, and kinematics of the lumbar spine (LS) during sit to stand (STS) in adolescent patients with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Fifty LBP patients were recruited and were randomly divided into two groups: Vibration group (n = 25) and placebo group (n = 25). All participants underwent 36-sessions of training consisting of six exercises. The Vibration group provided vibration stimulation during exercise, but the placebo group did not. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and digital dual inclinometer were used to measure pain intensity and proprioception. The kinematics of the lumbar spine during STS were measured by motion capture system. After training, the pain and proprioception in the vibration group improved significantly greater than the placebo group (p < 0.05). The mobility of LS (maximum range of motion, angular velocity, lumbar to hip movement ratios) and lumbar-hip coordination during STS in the vibration group were significantly improved compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Thus, trunk stabilization exercise combined with vibration may be used to improve the pain, proprioception, and kinematic of the lumbar spine during sit to stand in adolescent patients with LBP.  MP:   The aim of this study was to determine whether a 12-week course of low-frequency vibrating board therapy is a feasible therapy for non-specific chronic low back pain, and whether it improves the main outcome measures.   Randomized controlled trial.   A total of 50 patients with non-specific low back pain were included. They were randomly assigned to either a vibrating plate via reciprocation therapy group (n = 25) or a control group (n = 25).   The 12-week vibration therapy programme consisted of a total of 24 training sessions (2 times/week, with 1 day of rest between sessions). Assessments of the main outcome measures for non-specific low back pain were performed at baseline and at 12 weeks.   In the vibration therapy group there was a statistically significant improvement, of 20.37% (p = 0.031) in the Postural Stability Index (anterior-posterior); 25.15% (p = 0.013) in the Oswestry Index; 9.31% in the Roland Morris Index (p = 0.001); 8.57% (p = 0.042) in EuroQol 5D-3L; 20.29% (p = 0.002) in the Sens test; 24.13% (p = 0.006) in visual analogue scale back; and 16.58% (p = 0.008) in the Progressive Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation test.   A 12-week course of low-frequency vibrating board therapy is feasible and may represent a novel physical therapy for patients with non-specific low back pain.\\\" MP: As a local vibration therapy, deep muscle stimulation therapy can effectively relieve the pain and functional limitation caused by traction or fatigue, lactic acid accumulation, or fascia adhesion. However, less is reported on its effect on chronic non-specific low back pain.    To investigate the effect of deep muscle stimulation therapy on the changes of psoas surface electromyography as well as spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.   This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 102 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain admitted to Yancheng No. 1 People\\u2019s Hospital from February 2019 to June 2020 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups (n=51 per group): a control group and an observation group. Patients in the control group received a traditional lumbar stabilization exercise, and patients in the observation group received deep muscle stimulation therapy based on the lumbar stabilization exercise. Clinical efficacy, pain degree, lumbar spine function, psoas surface electromyography changes, spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters, quality of life, and adverse reactions were statistically analyzed before treatment, 1 and 6 months after treatment.    AND  The overall efficiency of the observation group (96%) was higher than that of the control group (82%; P < 0.05). After 1 and 6 months of treatment, the visual analog scale scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The maximal electromyographic value of the multifidus and musculi rotatores at 60\\u00b0 anteflexion, 90\\u00b0 abduction, and 45\\u00b0 extension was significantly higher in the observation group than the control group (P < 0.05). The step length symmetry index, foot deflection angle symmetry index, standing relative index, initial double support vertical ground reaction force, single support phase vertical ground reaction force, and terminal double support vertical ground reaction force were lower in the observation group than the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the Oswestry dysfunction index was lower (P < 0.05), and the SF-36 score was higher in the observation group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group and control group were 3.9% (2/51) and 5.9% (3/51), respectively, and there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). To conclude, deep muscle stimulation therapy can relieve pain, restore lumbar function and improve gait in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. \\\" MP: As a local vibration therapy, deep muscle stimulation therapy can relieve pain and loose fascia adhesion through a specific frequency of mechanical wave by hitting pain points, but less is reported on the changes of muscle tone and stiffness of erector spinaes after its effect on chronic non-specific low back pain.  To observe the effect of deep muscle stimulation on muscle tone and stiffness of erector spinaes as well as clinical efficacy in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain by a digital muscle detector.  A total of 60 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University from September 2019 to June 2021 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups (n=30 per group): a control group and an experimental group. Patients in the control group received the routine physical therapies, including core muscle group practice, stereodynamic interference electrotherapy and health education, and patients in the experimental group received deep muscle stimulation therapy based on the routine physical therapies, five times per week, for 4 consecutive weeks. Pain degree, waist function, changes of muscle tone and stiffness of the erector spinae muscle, and clinical efficacy were statistically analyzed before treatment, after the first treatment, after the completion of all treatments, and 4 weeks after treatment.   AND  After the first treatment, the oscillation frequency (F value), visual analog scale scores and stiffness values of the two groups were significantly lowered (P < 0.05), except for the oscillation frequency of the control group (P > 0.05). After the completion of all treatments, the visual analog scale scores, oscillation frequency, dynamic stiffness, and Quebec Baclain Disability Scale scores of the two groups were significantly lower than before treatment (P < 0.05), while the experimental group was better than the control group (P < 0.05). Four weeks after treatment, the Quebec baclain disability scale scores of two groups were improved compared with those after the completion of all treatments (P < 0.05), and the Quebec baclain disability scale score in the control group was significantly improved compared with that in the experimental group (P < 0.05). The number of effective and total effective cases in the experimental group were both better than those in the control group (P < 0.05) after the completion of all treatments. The overall efficiency of the experimental group (97%) was higher than that of the control group (80%; P < 0.05). Four weeks after treatment, the number of effective and total effective cases in the experimental group were also better than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The overall efficiency of the control group (63%) was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Although the overall efficiency of the experimental group (93%) decreased (P < 0.05), the clinical efficacy was mainly maintained. To conclude, deep muscle stimulation with routine physical therapies can effectively relieve pain, reduce muscle tone and stiffness of erector spinaes, and improve and keep the clinical efficacy in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. \\\"           \",\n          \"MP:The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk of heart disease in individuals who underwent cholecystectomy. This was a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Service database of South Korea. A total of 146,928 patients who underwent cholecystectomy and 268,502 age- and sex-matched controls were compared. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for heart disease after cholecystectomy. In , a previous history of cholecystectomy increased the risk of heart disease (congestive heart failure [CHF], myocardial infarction [MI], atrial fibrillation [AF]) (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.40, 95% CI: [1.36-1.44]). The increased risk was particularly seen for CHF (1.22 [1.16-1.29]) but not for MI and AF (p > 0.05). In the subgroup analyses, cholecystectomy was associated with an increased risk of MI in patients aged <65 years (1.49 [1.16-1.92] and 1.18 [1.05-1.35] in patients aged 40-49 and 50-64 years, respectively), but not in those aged \\u2265 65 years (0.932 [0.838-1.037]). Moreover, the risk of MI was increased in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) (1.16 [1.06-1.27]); however, it was decreased in patients with DM (0.83 [0.72-0.97]). In contrast, cholecystectomy did not modify the risk of AF in the subgroup analyses (all p > 0.05). In conclusion, a history of cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of CHF. Cholecystectomy may increase the risk of MI in the younger population without DM. These findings suggest that the alteration of bile metabolism and homeostasis might be potentially associated with the development of some heart diseases. MP:Knowledge about temporal associations for screen-detected gallstone disease and cardiovascular disease is limited. The objective of this study was to determine if screen-detected gallstones or cholecystectomy was associated with development of cardiovascular disease. A cohort study of three randomly selected groups from the general population of Copenhagen was performed. Participants (n = 5928) were examined 1982-1992 and underwent abdominal ultrasound examination to detect gallstone disease and were not informed of their gallstone status. Participants were followed up for occurrence of cardiovascular disease through nationwide registers until December 2014. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed including traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors and apolipoprotein E genotype. Gallstone disease was identified in 10% (591/5928) of participants at baseline of whom 6.8% had gallstones and 3.2% had cholecystectomy. The study population was followed for a period of 32 years with only 1% lost to follow-up. Gallstone disease was associated with all cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio (HR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.17;1.59]) and to the subgroups coronary artery (HR 1.34, 95% CI [1.10;1.64]), cerebrovascular (HR 1.22, 95% CI [0.97;1.52]), and peripheral artery disease (HR 1.57, 95% CI [1.15;2.13]). No differences in estimates were identified for gallstones detected at ultrasound or cholecystectomy. Adjustment did not change estimates substantially. Gallstone disease seems to be independently associated to cardiovascular disease. Associations cannot be explained through traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, apolipoprotein E4 allele, or detection bias. Future studies should explore the link between gallstone and cardiovascular disease further and gut microbiota may be a candidate mechanism.  MP:   Gallstone disease has been related to cardiovascular risk factors; however, whether presence of gallstones predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well established.  Approach and  We followed up 269 142 participants who were free of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline from 3 US cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (112 520 women; 1980-2010), Nurses' Health Study II (112 919 women; 1989-2011), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (43 703 men; 1986-2010) and documented 21 265 incident CHD cases. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio for the participants with a history of gallstone disease compared with those without was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.21) in Nurses' Health Study, 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.51) in Nurses' Health Study II, and 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.20) in Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The associations seemed to be stronger in individuals who were not obese, not diabetic, or were normotensive, compared with their counterparts. We identified 4 published prospective studies by searching PUBMED and EMBASE up to October 2015, coupled with our 3 cohorts, involving 842 553 participants and 51 123 incident CHD cases. The  from meta-analysis revealed that a history of gallstone disease was associated with a 23% (15%-33%) increased CHD risk.   Our findings support that a history of gallstone disease is associated with increased CHD risk, independently of traditional risk factors.\\\" MP:   Gallstones are common disorders associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Gallstone formation and atherosclerosis may share key pathways, but studies on putative associations between gallstones and the risk of cardiovascular disease are sparse and non-conclusive. We studied the relationship between gallstones and the risk of subsequent cardiovascular diseases in the German arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).   The study comprises 46,468 participants from EPIC-Potsdam and EPIC-Heidelberg aged 35-65 years, free of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at baseline. Information about the gallstone status at baseline was ascertained via questionnaires. For all incident cases of myocardial infarction and stroke confirmation was obtained from the treating physician. Relative risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.   During eight years of follow-up, 919 participants suffered a stroke or myocardial infarction. After multivariable adjustment for established risk factors, subjects with reported gallstones (n = 4828) had an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (hazard rate ratio (HR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.50). In individuals, who underwent a cholecystectomy before baseline a 1.32-fold increase in risk was observed (95%CI: 1.05, 1.65). HRs differed depending on the presence of selected established risk factors (e.g. HR for cardiovascular diseases regarding gallstones in smokers = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.20, 2.30, and non-smokers = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.86, 1.38).  Conclusions: Our  indicate an increased cardiovascular risk for gallstone formers, which cannot be counteracted by gallbladder removal and opens up perspectives for individualized prevention strategies.\\\" MP:   Gallstone disease (GSD) is related to multiple cardiovascular risk factors; the present study was to prospectively examine the association between GSD and ischemic heart disease (IHD).  Approach and  We examined the association of GSD with IHD among 199 292 men and 288 081 women aged 30-79 years in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke at baseline were excluded. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the association of GSD with IHD. The prevalence of self-reported GSD was 3.7% in men and 7.3% in women at baseline. During 3 431 124 person-years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median, 7.2 years), we documented 10 245 incident IHD cases in men and 14 714 in women. As compared with men without GSD at baseline, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for IHD was 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22) for men with GSD; the respective hazard ratio was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.34) in women and 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.28) in the whole cohort. The sex difference in IHD risk associated with GSD was statistically significant (P=0.009 for interaction with sex). In addition, we found that the association between GSD and IHD was stronger in nonhypertensive than in hypertensive women (P<0.001 for interaction).  Conclusions: In this large prospective study, the presence of GSD was associated with an increased risk of incident IHD, independent of other risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Our findings suggest novel prevention strategy to mitigate heart disease through improvement of gastrointestinal health.\\\" MP:  Background and  Gallstones and stroke are common diseases worldwide. The relationship between gallstones and stroke has been documented in the literature. In this work, to characterize the risk of stroke among gallstone patients with and without cholecystectomy, we investigated the effects of cholecystectomy in a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study.   Data were obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The study comprised 155 356 gallstone patients divided into two groups: those with and without cholecystectomy.   During the study period (2000-2012), 19 096 (17.8/1000 person-years) gallstone patients without cholecystectomy and 11 913 (10.6/1000 person-years) gallstone patients with cholecystectomy had a stroke. Following gallstone removal, the patients exhibited a significant decrease in the risk of overall stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-0.61), ischemic stroke (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.58-0.61), and hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.53-0.59). Asymptomatic and symptomatic gallstone patients had lower overall stroke risk after cholecystectomy (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.62-0.67 and HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.56-0.59) than did asymptomatic gallstone patients without cholecystectomy.  Conclusions: This population-based cohort study demonstrated that cholecystectomy is related to reduce the risk of overall stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. Preventive measures for stroke may be considered for gallstone patients, particularly those presenting risk factor(s) for stroke.\\\" MP:Objective  To investigate whether gallstone disease (GD) increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a large population-based cohort. Methods  A study population including 6,981 patients with GD was identified from The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2004 and 2005. GD patients were defined as patients with principal discharge diagnoses of cholelithiasis using the ICD-9-CM code 574. 27,924 patients without GD were randomly selected and matched for age and gender. All patients were followed for 6 years or until diagnosis for CVD. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the risk of developing CVD with adjustment for age, gender and co-morbid conditions.   During the six years follow-up period, 935 patients with GD and 2,758 patients without GD developed CVD. Patients with GD had an elevated risk of CVD (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.22-1.43) when compared with those without GD. Similar relationship was observed when CVD was categorized i.e. stroke (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32), coronary heart disease (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28-1.58) and heart failure (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.00-1.73). When GD was classified according to the level of severity, using patients without GD as reference, the risks of CVD were elevated in patients with non-severe GD (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24-1.46) as well as those with severe GD (HR, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.02-1.40), after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. In age-stratified analysis, patients aged 18-40 years with GD were at higher risk of developing CVD (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.84) than older GD patients. Conclusion  This study found an increased risk of CVD in patients diagnosed with GD. The excess risk was particularly high in younger GD patients. Prevention of GD could help reduce the risk of developing CVD, and the better effect could be achieved for the younger age groups.\\\" MP:A relationship between cholesterol gallstone disease and atherosclerosis or its sequellae has long been postulated but has never been adequately proven. Data for this investigation of the relationship of diagnosed cholesterol cholelithiasis to subsequent incident coronary heart disease were obtained from a review of the pre-existing prospectively collected medical records of the 5,209 individuals followed since 1952 as members of the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. Preliminary univariate examination of these data, making no correction for time ordering of the conditions or for shared risk factors, indicated a significant modest positive association in men but no relationship in women. Logistic multiple regression analyses, allowing for the effects of time ordering and for eight standard coronary disease risk factors, confirmed these findings. The authors speculate that the presence of cholesterol gallstones in male patients may be indicative of an unfavorable lipoprotein profile. These  have clinical implications in that male gallstone patients are at increased risk for subsequent coronary disease and should be monitored accordingly. This investigation marks the first time that a relationship between these conditions has been established using a longitudinal cohort study approach. \",\n          \"MP:Background Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been associated with aortic dissection (AD), but the magnitude of this association and its independence from confounders have not yet been established.  Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in 82 patients with Stanford's Type B AD and 116 controls from May 2009 to October 2012. A sleep study was performed in both groups using a modified Berlin questionnaire and polysomnography. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with AD. A third study in controls with OSAS but without AD was performed to prospectively assess the incidence of AD onset during follow-up. Cases and controls were matched for confounding factors.  Conclusions OSAS is highly prevalent and independently associated with Stanford's Type B AD. OSAS comorbidity should be considered in patients with clinically silent AD. Therapeutic strategy for patient with coexisting AD and OSAS such as continuous positive airway pressure and beta blockers needs to be evaluated.  Results Cases had significantly higher Berlin scores than controls (75.6% vs. 54.3% high risk, P = 0.002). OSAS frequency was 81.7% among patients and 67.2% among controls (P = 0.024). Patients with Stanford's Type B AD had higher apneas-hypopneas index (17.4 vs. 7.0 events/hr, P = 0.001) and mean 4% oxygen desaturation index (16 vs. 7 events/hr, P = 0.005) and a lower SaO2 during sleep (average 87% vs. 93%, P = 0.005) than controls. In a logistic regression model, OSAS was independently associated with Stanford's Type B AD (odds ratio 1.063, 95% confidence interval: 1.010-1.120; P = 0.020). Two patients developed AD during the prospective study. Both patients had serious OSAS and high Berlin risk, respectively. In addition, patients with coexisting AD and OSAS were significantly younger.  MP:Background Sleep apnea (SA) was associated with increased prevalence of aortic dissection (AD) in studies that were criticized for either their small sample size or lack of prospective observation. Using a considerably larger nationwide, population-based database and a long-term prospective cohort design, our study strived to explore the relationship between SA and the subsequent development of AD. Methods From 2000 to 2007, we gathered a study cohort consisting of 15,848 newly diagnosed cases of SA from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. For the control group, another 39,826 individuals without SA were matched for age, sex, and comorbidity. The two cohorts were followed-up to observe the occurrence of AD. Results During an average 3.59 \\u00b1 2.41 years of follow-up, we observed 33 cases of new AD occurrence [non-SA (22, 0.1%) vs. SA (11, 0.1%), p = 0.669], and the incidence of AD was similar for both groups. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity, only age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01\\u20131.06; p = 0.006], male gender (HR 2.49; 95% CI, 1.07\\u20135.79; p = 0.034), and hypertension (HR 6.28; 95% CI, 2.36\\u201316.67; p < 0.001) were independently associated with AD diagnosis. Conclusion SA was not associated with an increased risk of AD using a large nationwide cohort database. Nonetheless, larger prospective studies or meta-analyses are recommended to confirm our findings.

In addition, patients with coexisting AD and OSAS were significantly younger.  MP:Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a process that is associated with the development of arterial hypertension, the main risk factor for aortic dissection and during obstructive episodes of the upper airways with marked increases in transmural pressure of the aorta wall. The aim of this work was to study the association between aortic dissection and OSAS. Nineteen consecutive patients with thoracic aorta dissection and 19 hypertensive patients of similar age, sex, and body mass index were studied by clinical questionnaire and polysomnography. Snoring and nonrefreshing sleep were common in both groups. Thirteen patients (68%) from each group showed an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 5 per hour. However, patients with aortic dissection presented a higher apnea-hypopnea index (28 [30.3] versus 11.1 [10.4], p = 0.032). Seven patients with dissection presented an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 30 versus 1 patient in the control group (p = 0.042). Patients with thoracic aorta dissection presented a high prevalence of previously undiagnosed and frequently severe OSAS. Further studies, including this diagnosis as a prognostic variable in the follow-up of patients with aortic dissection, are required. Our results suggest that in patients with aortic dissection and symptoms consistent with OSAS, a sleep study should be considered in their clinical management.  MP:Background: The pathogenesis and etiology of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are largely unknown. Preliminary data from patients with aortic dissection and abdominal aneurysms suggest a causal link of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on aortic disease. Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of OSA in patients with TAA compared to a matched control group. Method: In this prospective parallel-cohort study, we 2-to-1 matched 208 patients with verified TAA (at the aortic sinus and/or ascending aorta) to 104 controls without TAA according to sex, age, height, weight, and left ventricular ejection fraction. All participants underwent an ultrasound of the thoracic aorta and a level III respiratory polygraphy. OSA was defined as apnea-hypopnea index \\u22655/h. The prevalence of OSA was compared with conditional logistic regression and controlling for the matching variables. Results: A total of 312 patients (mean age 65 \\u00b1 11 years, 82% male, mean body mass index 27 \\u00b1 4 kg/m2) were successfully 2-to-1 matched in the final model. Prevalence of OSA was significantly higher in the TAA-group when compared to the matched control group (63 vs. 47%; odds ratio 1.87 [95% CI 1.05-3.34]; p = 0.03). When applying a higher apnea-hypopnea index threshold (\\u226515/h), the odds ratio increased to 3.25 (95% CI 1.65-6.42; p < 0.001). The median apnea-hypopnea index was higher in patients with TAA (9.2/h [3.3-20.0] vs. 4.5/h [2.2-11.1], p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with TAA have a higher prevalence of OSA when compared to the general population. Since OSA is effectively treatable and might contribute to the pathogenesis of TAA, further longitudinal trials are needed to assess the association between OSA and TAA.  MP:Objective: To investigate cardiac structural changes in elderly patients with obstructive sleep apnoeahypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) and the impact on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Methods: The study enrolled elderly patients with OSAHS and age-matched healthy control subjects. Cardiac structure, left ventricular diastolic function and left ventricular systolic function were measured using a Doppler ultrasound scanner and compared between the two groups. Results: The study included 136 patients with OSAHS and 50 healthy control subjects. There were significant differences in the echocardiography indicators that reflect cardiac structure, including interventricular septum, left ventricle posterior wall thickness, and left ventricular mass and mass index between the two groups. There were significant differences between the two groups in the ventricular septal early diastolic myocardial peak velocity/late diastolic myocardial peak velocity (Em/Am), mitral annulus Em/Am, and left ventricle posterior wall Em/Am. There were also significant differences in the indicators of interventricular septum, mitral annulus and left ventricular posterior wall systolic peak velocity between the two groups. Conclusion: Elderly patients with OSAHS demonstrated cardiac structural changes and their left ventricular diastolic and systolic functions were significantly diminished.   MP:Background: Structural and functional properties of the proximal thoracic aorta have important implications in clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with proximal aortic size and aortic stiffness in a multi-ethnic community-based cohort. Methods: The sample included the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep Ancillary study participants without known CVD who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The main exposure variable was OSA severity based on the polysomnography-derived apnea hypopnea index (AHI; normal, AHI <5/h; mild, 5\\u2264 AHI <15/h; moderate to severe, AHI \\u226515/h). The study outcomes were ascending aortic diameter (AoD, cm), aortic pulse wave velocity (AoPWV, m/s), and ascending aortic distensibility (AAD, %/mm Hg). Analyses were performed in the overall sample and in sex-specific strata, adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Results: The 708 participants were 55.9% female and on average 68 years old (54-93 years). There was a significant trend (p < 0.0001) of greater mean (SD) AoD across the three OSA groups: normal (n = 87), 3.13 cm (0.35); mild (n = 215), 3.25 (0.34); moderate to severe (n = 406), 3.37 (0.36). In adjusted analysis, participants with moderate to severe OSA had a greater mean AoD compared with the normal group: adjusted mean difference (95% CI), 0.12 cm (0.05, 0.20), p = 0.002. This AoD gradient was observed in women but not in men (p for interaction = 0.02). No differences were found in AoPWV or AAD among the OSA groups. Conclusion: In a diverse community-based cohort, moderate to severe OSA (vs. no OSA) was associated with a larger ascending AoD in women.  MP:Purpose This study aims to assess changes in cardiac imageology of patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without cardiovascular disease. Methods All enrolled participants underwent polysomnography (PSG). Some participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography, speckle tracking echocardiography, and cardiac-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if they were willing. They were divided into three groups according to PSG results: non-OSA, mild OSA, and moderate-to-severe OSA. Imageology parameters were compared, and the relationship between OSA severity and imageology indices was analyzed by correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. Results Of the 352 enrolled participants, 274 participants with OSA had an apnea\\u2013hypopnea index (AHI) of\\u2009\\u2265\\u20095 (86 mild OSA and 188 moderate-to-severe OSA cases), and 78 participants with non-OSA had an AHI of\\u2009<\\u20095. Transthoracic echocardiography showed that E/A and E\\u2019/A\\u2019 values were lower in the mild OSA group than in the non-OSA group (1.12\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.37 vs 1.27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.45 and 0.83\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.33 vs 0.99\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.42, respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The aorta and ascending aorta widths were smaller in the mild OSA group than in the moderate-and-severe OSA groups (27.36\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.87 mm vs 28.87\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.95 mm and 30.27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.79 mm vs 31.63\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.74 mm, respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). A regression analysis showed that cardiac function changes in patients with OSA may be related to age, obesity, and OSA severity. Conclusion Patients with mild OSA without cardiovascular disease displayed changes in cardiac structure and function on transthoracic echocardiography.  MP:Background: Recent studies suggest that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes thoracic aortic dilatation; but it is well accepted that hypertension can cause aortic dilatation, and hypertension is a common finding in patients with OSA. We aimed to investigate the relative impact of OSA and hypertension on the structural and functional changes of the thoracic aorta. Methods: This was an echocardiography substudy of our prospective OSA study in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Ninety-four male patients who completed both echocardiography and polysomnography were recruited. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \\u2265 15/hour. Results: The patients' mean age was 53 \\u00b1 10 years, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.6 \\u00b1 3kg/m 2. Sixty-four (68.1%) patients had OSA; of these, 39 (41.5%) had severe OSA. Thirty-three (52.6%) of the OSA cohort had hypertension. There was no correlation between any of the echocardiographic parameters and thoracic aortic size. Stepwise multivariate regression showed that BMI (P = 0.024), older age (P = 0.044), and hypertension (P = 0.025) were the only determinants. There was no significant independent relationship between OSA/ AHI and thoracic aortic size. Systolic blood pressure but not AHI correlated significantly with aortic distensibility and compliance (r = -0.40 and -0.26, P < 0.001 and 0.022, respectively). Conclusions: Hypertension is a common finding in male AMI patients with OSA. In these patients, increased afterload from systemic hypertension rather than mechanical stress on the aortic wall determines the thoracic aortic size and abnormalities in aortic functional indices. BMI and age were also independent predictors of thoracic aortic dilatation.  MP:Study Objective Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been considered to be an important predisposing factor for cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the impact of OSAS on cardiac function and remodeling in patients without congestive heart failure. Methods A total of 79 patients with sleep disordered breathing, preserved systolic function, and normal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level were enrolled. Sixty-five patients were classified to have moderate to severe OSAS (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] \\u2265 15/h), while the other 14 patients with mild or no OSAS (AHI < 15/h) served as control subjects. Baseline clinical and polysomnographic variables as well as tissue Doppler imaging and three-dimensional echocardiographic parameters were obtained. Results The body mass index, neck circumference, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, desaturation index, arousal index, and snoring index were significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe OSAS than those without (p < 0.05). The left atrial size, mitral A-wave velocity, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were significantly larger, while E/A ratio was lower in patients with moderate to severe OSAS than those without (p < 0.05). Notably, AHI in REM sleep was significantly correlated with the aortic root size, E/A ratio, left ventricular volume, and stroke volume. In addition, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for AHI in REM sleep \\u2265 32.3/h was 0.647 (95% CI [0.525, 0.769]) in predicting the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. AHI in REM sleep \\u2265 32.3/h was the only independent variant in predicting diastolic dysfunction after adjusting the variables including age, gender, hypertension, and body mass index. Conclusions Patients with moderate to severe OSAS tend to have cardiac dysfunction revealed by echocardiography. High AHI in REM sleep is significantly associated with cardiovascular remodeling and ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and may be a potential variable to predict cardiac dysfunction.

However, the potential of tDCS to enhance sport-specific motor performance in athletes remains elusive. Objective  We aimed at analyzing the acute effects of a single anodal tDCS session on sport-specific motor performance changes in athletes compared to sham. Methods  A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The meta-analysis was performed using an inverse variance method and a random-effects model. Additionally, two subgroup analyses were conducted (1) depending on the stimulated brain areas (primary motor cortex (M1), temporal cortex (TC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CB)), and (2) studies clustered in subgroups according to different sports performance domains (endurance, strength, visuomotor skill). Results  A total number of 19 studies enrolling a sample size of 258 athletes were deemed eligible for inclusion. Across all included studies, a significant moderate standardized mean difference (SMD) favoring anodal tDCS to enhance sport-specific motor performance could be observed. Subgroup analysis depending on cortical target areas of tDCS indicated a significant moderate SMD in favor of anodal tDCS compared to sham for M1 stimulation. Conclusion  A single anodal tDCS session can lead to performance enhancement in athletes in sport-specific motor tasks. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the modes of action as a function of performance domain or stimulation site, these results imply intriguing possibilities concerning sports performance enhancement through anodal M1 stimulation.\",\n          \"The effect of stress on Graves' disease (GD) is controversial. Our purpose was to quantify the impacts of stress on patients with Graves' disease.   Systematic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsycInfo were conducted from inception to 1 January 2023. Studies comparing the incidence of stressful life events (SLEs) that occurred before diagnosis and during drug therapy in cases diagnosed with GD and controls were included in the final analysis.  : Nine case-control studies and four cohort studies enrolling 2892 participants (1685 [58%] patients) were included. Meta-analysis revealed a high and significant effect-size index in a random effect model (d = 1.81, P = 0.01), indicating that stress is an important factor in the onset of GD. The relationship between SLEs and GD was stronger in studies with higher proportions of female patients (\\u03b2 = 0.22, P < 0.01) and weaker in studies with older patients with GD (\\u03b2 =-0.62, P < 0.01). However, stress did not significantly affect the outcome of antithyroid drug therapy for GD (d = 0.32, P = 0.09).  Conclusions: The  of this meta-analysis suggest that stress is one of the environmental triggers for the onset of GD. Therefore, we recommend stress management assistance for individuals genetically susceptible to GD, especially for young females.\",\n          \"Novel disease-specific and mechanism-based treatments sharing good evidence of efficacy for migraine have been recently marketed. However, rembursement by insurers depends on treatment failure with classic anti-migraine drugs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify and rate the evidence for efficacy of flunarizine, a repurposed, first- or second-line treatment for migraine prophylaxis.   A systematic search in MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed for trials of pharmacological treatment in migraine prophylaxis, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). Eligible trials for meta-analysis were randomized, placebo-controlled studies comparing flunarizine with placebo. Outcomes of interest according to the Outcome Set for preventive intervention trials in chronic and episodic migraine (COSMIG) were the proportion of patients reaching a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, the change in monthly migraine days (MMDs), and Adverse Events (AEs) leading to discontinuation.  : Five trials were eligible for narrative description and three for data synthesis and analysis. No studies reported the predefined outcomes, but one study assessed the 50% reduction in monthly migraine attacks with flunarizine as compared to placebo showing a benefit from flunarizine with a low or probably low risk of bias. We found that flunarizine may increase the proportion of patients who discontinue due to adverse events compared to placebo (risk difference: 0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06).  Conclusions: Published flunarizine trials predate the recommended endpoints for evaluating migraine prophylaxis drugs, hence the lack of an adequate assessment for these endpoints. Further, modern-day, large-scale studies would be valuable in re-evaluating the efficacy of flunarizine for the treatment of migraines, offering additional insights into its potential benefits.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Meta_Paper\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3812,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"was a prospective clinical trial study. Patients with severe sleep apnea (40) were randomized into two groups. Multiple questionnaire investigation and laboratory evaluation were performed for ED, severity of OSAS and psychological status. Group 1 was treated with CPAP and group 2 was treated with only antidepressant medication for at least 1 month. Patients were evaluated after 1 month of therapy and compared with initial ones. Before CPAP, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 scores were significantly correlated only with body mass index (BMI; P=0.007) and not correlated significantly with Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (P=0.286), lowest SaO(2) (P=0.182), Beck's Depression Inventory scores (P=0.302) and apnea/hypopnea index (P=0.279). After 1 month of regular CPAP usage, mean value of IIEF-5 score was 15.71+/-5.12 before CPAP and were improved up to 19.06+/-3.94, statistically significant. All subjects responded positively to the CPAP treatment and their erection status was improved positively. We have found a correlation between severe OSAS and ED.

The researcher responsible for randomisation was masked to responses. Participants in the ENO Breathe group participated in a 6-week online breathing and wellbeing programme, developed for people with long COVID experiencing breathlessness, focusing on breathing retraining using singing techniques. Those in the deferred group received usual care until they exited the trial. The primary outcome, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, was change in HRQoL, assessed using the RAND 36-item short form survey instrument mental health composite (MHC) and physical health composite (PHC) scores. Secondary outcome measures were the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test score, visual analogue scales (VAS) for breathlessness, and scores on the dyspnoea-12, the generalised anxiety disorder 7-item scale, and the short form-6D. A thematic analysis exploring participant experience was also conducted using qualitative data from focus groups, survey responses, and email correspondence. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04830033.  Findings: Between April 22 and May 25, 2021, 158 participants were recruited and randomly assigned. Of these, eight (5%) individuals were excluded and 150 participants were allocated to a treatment group (74 in the ENO Breathe group and 76 in the usual care group). Compared with usual care, ENO Breathe was associated with an improvement in MHC score (regression coefficient 2\\u00b742 [95% CI 0\\u00b703 to 4\\u00b780]; p=0\\u00b7047), but not PHC score (0\\u00b760 [-1\\u00b733 to 2\\u00b752]; p=0\\u00b754). VAS for breathlessness (running) favoured ENO Breathe participation (-10\\u00b748 [-17\\u00b723 to -3\\u00b773]; p=0\\u00b70026).

Conclusion: There is high patronage of HM especially pre-packaged herbal preparations by women in the Tamale metropolis before and during pregnancy. Health care providers should educate pregnant women about the possible effect herbal medicines could have on their babies. Manufacturers of herbal products should clearly indicate pregnancy being a contraindication and vendors should also be careful in selling these products to pregnant women.  MP:Self-medication in pregnancy is a concern in Ghana. We assessed the practice among 136 pregnant women in Effutu and Agona West Municipalities using facility-based, cross-sectional design and mixed method approach of data collection. Our findings show that pregnant women of varying backgrounds self-medicate for sociocultural and economic reasons, with 69% prevalence, motivated by cheaper treatment cost (17%), minor ailments (29%) and positive outcomes (33%). Commonly used medications include antibiotics (23%), pain killers (20%) and herbal preparations (19%). We recommend further studies on pharmacological compositions of the medications used and effects on pregnancy outcomes to inform policy and programs decisions.  MP:Background: The dangers of self-medication, especially during pregnancy for both the woman and the fetus, have been extensively researched and documented. Objective: The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence of self-medication and associated factors among pregnant women in the Hohoe Municipality of the Volta Region. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed to collect quantitative data from 371 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Hohoe Municipality.
