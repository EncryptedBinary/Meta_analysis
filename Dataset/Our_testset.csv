"Mindfulness is characterized by skills such as heightened awareness and acceptance of internal experiences, which may be helpful for people who have experienced trauma. The consistency and strength of the relationship between trait mindfulness and PTSD symptomology, however, is unknown. Studies were included in this review if they were published in an English language peer-reviewed journal, reported on a correlational relationship between validated measures of mindfulness and PTSD, and all participants were over the age of 18. A random effects meta-analysis showed that there was a robust, pooled relationship between total mindfulness and PTSD (r+ = −0.39, 95% CI [-0.47 to −0.30]), based on 35 datasets with 13,370 participants, with low risk of publication bias. Sixteen articles reported on facets of mindfulness and PTSD symptomology [5,206 to 5,600 participants]: the strongest associations were with Act with Awareness (r+ = −0.37) and Non-judge (r+ = −0.37), followed by Describe (r+ = −0.22) and Non-react (r+ = −0.21). Observe was not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms. Results from this analysis suggest that people who are more mindful also report fewer symptoms of PTSD ; the strength of the relationship varies across mindfulness facets. There was high heterogeneity across studies.  ","MP: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major challenge among war veterans. This study assessed the contribution of several interrelated, modifiable psychosocial factors to changes in PTSD symptom severity among combat-deployed post-9/11 Veterans. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study of predictors of mental health and functional outcomes among U.S. Iraq and Afghanistan war Veterans (N = 117). This study assessed the unique contribution of psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and self-compassion to PTSD recovery, after accounting for established predictors of PTSD chronicity, including combat exposure, alcohol use problems, and traumatic brain injury. PTSD symptom severity was assessed using a clinician-administered interview, and PTSD recovery was defined as the change in symptom severity from lifetime worst severity, measured at baseline, to current severity at one-year follow-up. A mindful awareness latent factor comprised of all three variables measured at baseline predicted PTSD recovery beyond the other predictors of PTSD chronicity (f2 = 0.30, large effect). Each construct predicted PTSD recovery when tested individually. When tested simultaneously, self-compassion, but not mindfulness or psychological flexibility, predicted PTSD recovery. These findings suggest that mindful awareness of emotional distress predicts recovery from PTSD symptoms in war veterans, which supports the utility mindfulness-based interventions in promoting post-trauma recovery.  MP: Objective Two of the most common and costly mental health diagnoses among military veterans who served in the post-9/11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, but over half of veterans who screen positive for these problems do not seek treatment. A key barrier is self-stigma of mental illness. Mindfulness has shown promise as an explanatory variable in the context of mental health symptoms and self-stigma, but these associations are underexplored in the veterans’ literature. This study examines direct and indirect effects among mindfulness, PTSD and depression, and self-stigma in post-9/11-era military veterans. Method A sample of 577 veterans from 3 large American cities completed surveys capturing mindfulness, symptoms of PTSD and depression, and self-stigma. A structural equation modeling approach was used to examine direct and indirect effects among study variables. Results Mindfulness was associated with less PTSD and depression and indirectly with less self-stigma through the PTSD pathway. PTSD was associated with more depression and self-stigma, and depression was not significantly associated with self-stigma. Conclusion PTSD is strongly associated with self-stigma in military veterans, many of whom do not seek mental health treatment. Findings show that mindfulness is a promising intervention target for reducing symptoms of PTSD directly and reducing associated self-stigma of mental illness indirectly. Additional investigation of links between mindfulness, PTSD and depressive symptoms, and self-stigma in military veterans is warranted.  MP: This study evaluated the concurrent associations between mindful attention and awareness and psychopathology symptoms among adults exposed to trauma. Participants included 76 adults (35 women; Mage = 30.0 years, SD = 12.5) who reported experiencing one or more traumatic events. As hypothesized, levels of mindful attention and awareness were significantly negatively associated with levels of posttraumatic stress symptom severity, psychiatric multimorbidity, anxious arousal, and anhedonic depression symptoms, beyond the large, positive effect of number of traumatic event types. In addition, statistical evaluation of the phenomenological pattern of these associations showed that high levels of mindfulness exclusively co-occurred with low levels of psychopathology symptoms or high rates of mental health; whereas low levels of mindfulness did not similarly exclusively co-occur with either low or high levels of psychopathology symptoms but rather co-occurred with a broad range of symptom levels. Findings are conceptualized in terms of transdiagnostic resilience and discussed in regard to extant empirical and theoretical work.  MP: Objectives Experiential acceptance and trait-mindfulness are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events. This study was a preliminary attempt to examine (1) associations of experiential acceptance and trait-mindfulness with post-traumatic stress (PTS) associated with negative, but not necessarily traumatizing, life events (‘analogue’ PTS), (2) the role of these variables in the context of neuroticism as well as worry and rumination – two other regulatory strategies associated with PTS, and (3) the impact of pre-trauma tendencies towards experiential acceptance and mindfulness on analogue PTS.  Design Data were obtained from two distinct student samples. A first sample provided cross-sectional data. In a second sample, indices of acceptance, mindfulness, neuroticism, worry, and rumination were tapped at inclusion into the study, and analogue PTS and confrontation with stressful life events were subsequently assessed 1 year later.  Results In the cross-sectional sample, higher acceptance and mindfulness were associated with lower analogue PTS, even when controlling for neuroticism, worry, and rumination. In the prospective sample, pre-trauma mindfulness (but not experiential acceptance, neuroticism, worry, and rumination) assessed at baseline predicted levels of analogue PTS 1 year later.  Conclusions Findings suggest that experiential acceptance and trait-mindfulness are incrementally related to PTS beyond neuroticism, worry, and rumination and that pre-trauma trait-mindfulness may be a resilience factor protecting against severe PTS.  Practitioner points We examined associations of experiential acceptance and trait-mindfulness with post-traumatic stress (PTS) associated with negative life events (‘analogue’ PTS). Experiential acceptance and trait-mindfulness were associated with concurrent analogue PTS, over and above neuroticism, worry, and rumination. Pre-trauma trait-mindfulness (but not pre-trauma experiential acceptance) significantly predicted analogue PTS in prospective analyses. Enhancing mindfulness skills could be a useful tool to reduce the risk of PTS in trauma-exposed samples.  MP: Although theory suggests the relevance of mindfulness and mindfulness-based therapies for understanding relationships between trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dissociative experiences, little research has directly compared associations between mindfulness and trauma-related distress versus dissociation, including dissociative trauma-related altered states of consciousness (TRASC). We therefore examined whether mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ]) partially mediated the relationship between self-reported trauma exposure, whether occurring during childhood or anytime in life, and outcomes of PTSD, dissociative subtype PTSD, and TRASC in 952 trauma-exposed participants surveyed online. The relationships between increased traumatic experiences and PTSD, dissociative PTSD, and TRASC were partially mediated by the decreased capacity for mindful describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging traits, although decreased mindful non-reactivity partially mediated only the association between increased childhood trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms, while increased mindful observing partially mediated the association between increased lifetime trauma exposure and increased PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Our findings suggest that altered or decreased capacity for different facets of trait mindfulness may be one mechanism by which trauma exposure leads to the development of trauma-related distress and dissociation.  MP: Mindfulness has increasingly been shown to be a resilience-promoting factor against the negative effects of stress and anxiety. While there is considerable literature evidencing that higher levels of mindfulness are associated with decreased stress and anxiety in civilian cross-sectional studies, fewer studies have examined this relationship utilizing longitudinal designs with recently deployed National Guard soldiers. The present study examined the resilience-promoting effects of mindfulness on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and general distress with members of Aviation (N = 52) and Infantry (N = 146) battalions of the Army National Guard who recently returned from deployment. Each study participant completed measures at two time points (3 and 12 months post-deployment) to examine whether mindfulness predicted symptom reporting over time. Overall, findings suggest that time 1 mindfulness is a significant predictor of time 2 general distress, anxiety, and the hyperarousal symptom cluster, but not time 2 total PTSD. Consistent with previous studies, these findings suggest that mindfulness measures may be useful for identifying soldiers at risk and resilient for post-deployment psychological distress. The implications for different diagnostic frameworks and criteria are considered.  MP: Exposure to traumatic events often results in severe distress which may elicit self-medication behaviors. Yet, some individuals exposed to trauma do not develop post-traumatic stress symptoms and comorbid addictive impulses. In the wake of traumatic events, psychological processes like thought suppression and mindfulness may modulate post-traumatic stress and craving for substances. We examined the differential roles of mindfulness and suppression in comorbid post-traumatic stress and craving among a sample of 125 persons with extensive trauma histories and psychiatric symptoms in residential treatment for substance dependence. Results indicated that thought suppression, rather than extent of trauma history, significantly predicted post-traumatic stress symptom severity while dispositional mindfulness significantly predicted both post-traumatic stress symptoms and craving. In multiple regression models, mindfulness and thought suppression combined explained nearly half of the variance in post-traumatic stress symptoms and one-quarter of the variance in substance craving. Moreover, multivariate path analysis indicated that prior traumatic experience was associated with greater thought suppression, which in turn was correlated with increased post-traumatic stress symptoms and drug craving, whereas dispositional mindfulness was associated with decreased suppression, post-traumatic stress, and craving. The maladaptive strategy of thought suppression appears to be linked with adverse psychological consequences of traumatic life events. In contrast, dispositional mindfulness appears to be a protective factor that buffers individuals from experiencing more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms and craving.  MP: Rates of both traumatic event exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 22%-54%) are disproportionately elevated among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Trauma and related psychopathology significantly affect quality of life and disease management in this patient population. The current study examined associations between internalized HIV stigma, mindfulness skills, and the severity of PTSD symptoms in trauma-exposed PLHA. Participants included 137 PLHA (14.6% female; Mage = 48.94, SD = 8.89) who reported experiencing on average, five (SD = 2.67) traumatic events; 34% met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Results indicate that after controlling for sex, age, education, and number of traumatic events, internalized HIV stigma was positively related to overall PTSD symptom severity (β = .16, p < .05) and severity of re-experiencing (β = .19, p < .05) and hyper-arousal (β = .16, p = .05), but not avoidance, PTSD symptom clusters. Among the mindfulness facets measured, acting with awareness was uniquely negatively related to the overall severity of PTSD symptoms (β = − .25, p < .01) and the severity of re-experiencing (β = − .25, p < .05), avoidance (β = − .25, p < .05), and hyper-arousal (β = − .29, p < .01) PTSD symptom clusters. These effects were observed after accounting for covariates and shared variance with other mindfulness facets. Theoretically, the present findings suggest that internalized HIV stigma may serve as a vulnerability factor for the severity of certain PTSD symptoms, whereas acting with awareness may function as a protective or resiliency factor for the severity of PTSD symptoms. Implications for the treatment of trauma-exposed PLHA are discussed.  MP: Background It has been suggested that mindfulness is a protective factor that buffers individuals from experiencing severe posttraumatic stress following exposure to a trauma.  We aimed to examine the association between dispositional (trait) mindfulness and posttraumatic stress in individuals who had been exposed to the trauma of a natural disaster.  Method A disaster group (n = 25) consisting of Norwegian tourists who survived the 2004 South East Asian tsunami at a location with high mortality rates was recruited. Dispositional mindfulness and posttraumatic stress were measured with the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Version, respectively.  Results There was no significant association between mindfulness and posttraumatic stress. Moreover, there were no significant associations between posttraumatic stress and the mindfulness sub-facets of observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting. However, there was a significant positive correlation between the descriptive factor of mindfulness and IES-R total. There were no significant linear correlations between the five sub-facets of mindfulness and the three categories of posttraumatic symptoms, intrusion, avoidance and hyper-arousal.  Conclusions Our findings do not indicate a relationship between dispositional mindfulness and posttraumatic stress levels after exposure to a trauma, except for the descriptive sub-facet of mindfulness and here the correlation is positive and not negative as would be expected if mindfulness is a protective factor for posttraumatic stress. Future studies should investigate the relationship between mindfulness and posttraumatic stress while accounting for factors such as trauma history, type of trauma, and individual differences in traumatic stress reactions.  MP: Objective: A growing body of theoretical and empirical work suggests that mindfulness may support more positive posttraumatic outcomes by reducing posttraumatic stress (PTS) and encouraging posttraumatic growth (PTG). Positive reappraisal (PR), a cognitive coping correlate of dispositional mindfulness (DM) has also been linked with greater PTG. However, neither DM nor PR have been modeled in relation to core posttraumatic constructs such as core belief disruption, intrusive rumination, deliberate rumination, PTS and PTG. Method: This study explored associations between these constructs in a sample of college students (N = 505), also investigating the impact of contemplative practice involvement on the relationships between the constructs. Results: Results indicate that including DM and PR into established models of PTG increases the model’s explanatory power, which distinct cognitive coping pathways connect DM and core belief disruption with PTS as well as PTG, and that contemplative practice involvement substantially alters relationships between the core PTG variables. Conclusions: The present study contributes to the growing reconceptualization of trauma as linked with both positive and pathogenic outcomes, emphasizing the need to better understand how posttraumatic cognitive coping strategies contribute to more positive outcomes.  MP: Objectives In the present study, we tested moderated mediation models where the moderator role of mindfulness and its subscales has an indirect effect of core belief disruption (CBD) on posttraumatic symptoms (PTS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) through intrusive (IR) and deliberate (DR) ruminations.  Methods Two hundred forty-six individuals, ages ranging between 19 and 77, with traumatic experiences participated in the study. The data were collected by Traumatic Experience Screening List, Core Beliefs Inventory (CBI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised Form (IES-R), Event-Related Rumination Inventory, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ).  Results The moderator role of mindfulness was supported both for PTS and PTG. The analysis indicated that the indirect effect of CBD on PTS only through IR was moderated by mindfulness total score (MF-T) and nonreactivity (NR) subscales. The analysis revealed that the MF-T × IR interaction effect was statistically significant. The interaction effect was significant for only low and medium levels of MF-T. When the model was analyzed for PTG, it was observed that the indirect effect of CBD on PTG through IR and DR was moderated significantly only for describing (DES) subscale of mindfulness. In addition, the DES × IR interaction effect was significant only for medium and higher levels of DES. It was also observed that the DES × DR interaction effect was significant only for medium and high levels of DES.  Conclusions Mindfulness and its components should be taken into consideration when assessing posttraumatic symptoms and growth.  MP: Background Although various studies found that mindfulness and emotion regulation strategies both could be the predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG), no study to date has examined the combined role of dispositional mindfulness and emotion regulation strategies in PTSD and PTG among firefighters.  Method A cross-sectional study conducted in a sample of 409 Chinese firefighters who reported to have experienced critical incidents during their daily work. Participants completed self-report questionnaires.  Results Dispositional mindfulness directly and negatively predicted PTSD and positively predicted PTG. Moreover, the proposed model fit the data well [χ2/df = 2.362, NFI = 0.973, IFI = 0.984, TLI = 0.974, CFI = 0.984, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.058 (0.040–0.076)]. Dispositional mindfulness exerted an indirect and negative effect on PTSD via cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. While dispositional mindfulness showed an indirect and positive effect on PTG through cognitive reappraisal, but not through expressive suppression.  Conclusions Emotion regulation strategies could mediate the relationship between dispositional mindfulness and posttraumatic outcomes in different ways. These findings highlight the beneficial effects of dispositional mindfulness on firefighters' mental health.  MP: Objective: Exposure to traumatic life events is associated with increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems such as suicidal ideation (SI), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and decreased quality of life (QOL). Mindfulness, which involves attending to the present moment, may help individuals cope with traumatic events by increasing acceptance of trauma-related experiences and decreasing trauma-related negative affect and avoidance of trauma reminders. The current study evaluated whether mindful attention to the present moment mediated the association between number of lifetime traumas and mental health. Method: The sample consisted of 1,268 trauma-exposed U.S. veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative study of U.S. veterans. On average, the sample was 60.6 years of age (SD = 15.2, range = 20–94), predominantly male (89.8%), Caucasian (75.0%), and noncombat veterans (59.2%). Results: Path analyses revealed that mindfulness partially mediated the relation between number of lifetime traumas and PTSD symptoms (β = −.55), AUD (β = −.17), and QOL (β = .38), and fully mediated the relation between number of lifetime traumas and SI (β = −.36). Conclusions: The relationship between lifetime trauma burden and various mental health issues of relevance to U.S. veterans may be mediated by mindfulness, or the ability to pay attention to the present moment. Interventions that bolster mindfulness may help mitigate the negative impact of cumulative traumas in this population.   MP: "
"Teen Psychological Dating Violence (TPDV) is a serious public health concern. However, there is limited evidence on the capacity of programs to prevent this form of violence. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of prevention programs for TPDV. PsycINFO/Eric/PsycArticles, PubMed and Web of Science were searched from inception through January 2021 to identify RCTs of prevention programs for adolescents that reported a measure of TPDV. The effect sizes were computed as the difference between the prevention program and control group at post or follow-up assessment by calculating Hedges's g with a random-effect model. Thirteen trials met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. There was a small but significant effect size in favor of the prevention group as compared to the control condition for victimization (g = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.37; p < 0.001) and perpetration (g = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.37; p < 0.001) of TPDV. Overall, the combined effect size for any TPDV perpetration/victimization was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.34; p < 0.001). Exploratory subgroup analysis showed that programs implemented at multiple levels (such as home, school, community) reported significantly larger effect sizes compared to single-level interventions. Significant differences in effect sizes were also associated with the type of scale used to assess TPDV. Current evidence suggests that intervention programs for TPDV may be effective, particularly when implemented at multiple levels. Further research focusing on refining tools to assess TPDV is needed.","MP: The Safe Dates Project is a randomized trial for evaluating a school-based adolescent dating violence prevention program. Five waves of data were used to examine the effects of Safe Dates over time including primary and secondary prevention effects, moderators, and mediators of program effects. Using random coefficients models, with multiple imputation of missing data, significant program effects were found at all four follow-up periods on psychological, moderate physical, and sexual dating violence perpetration and moderate physical dating violence victimization. Marginal effects were found on sexual victimization. Effects on severe physical perpetration at all four follow-up periods were moderated by prior involvement in that type of violence. Primary and secondary prevention effects were found and the program was equally effective for males and females and for whites and non-whites. Program effects were mediated by changes in dating violence norms, gender-role norms, and awareness of community services.  MP: Purpose To examine the effects of a family-based teen dating abuse prevention program, Families for Safe Dates, primarily on outcomes related to testing the conceptual underpinnings of the program including (1) factors motivating and facilitating caregiver engagement in teen dating abuse prevention activities, and 2) risk factors for teen dating abuse, and secondarily on dating abuse behaviors.  Methods Families were recruited nationwide using listed telephone numbers. Caregivers and teens completed baseline and 3-month follow-up telephone interviews (n = 324). Families randomly allocated to treatment condition received the Families for Safe Dates program including six mailed activity booklets followed-up by health educator telephone calls.  Results There were significant (<.05) treatment effects in hypothesized directions on most of the factors motivating and facilitating caregiver engagement in teen dating abuse prevention activities including caregiver perceived severity of dating abuse, response efficacy for preventing dating abuse, self-efficacy for talking about dating abuse, knowledge of dating abuse, acceptance of dating abuse, communication skills with the teen, and belief in the importance of involvement in their male (but not female) teen's dating. The latter effect was the only one moderated by sex of the teen. The targeted risk factor affected by the program was teen acceptance of dating abuse. Treatment was also significantly associated with less physical dating abuse victimization.  Conclusions Modifications to the program are warranted, but overall, the findings are very favorable for the first family-based teen dating abuse prevention program to be evaluated.  MP: This study examined the efficacy of a brief (four session) intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention program (Building a Lasting Love, Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al. 2005) that was designed to reduce the relationship violence of predominantly African American inner-city adolescent girls (n = 72) who were receiving teen pregnancy services. These high-risk girls were randomly assigned to the prevention program (n = 39) or waitlist control (n = 33) conditions. Implementation fidelity was documented. As predicted, girls who successfully completed the program (n = 24) reported significant reductions in their perpetration of psychological abuse toward their baby’s father as compared to the control (n = 23) participants. They also reported experiencing significantly less severe IPV victimization over the course of the program. Preliminary analyses indicated that avoidant attachment to one’s partner may be associated with less program-related change. These findings support the contention that brief IPV prevention programs can be targeted to selected groups of high-risk adolescents.  MP: Objectives. We examined whether It's Your Game . . . Keep It Real (IYG) reduced dating violence among ethnic-minority middle school youths, a population at high risk for dating violence. Methods. We analyzed data from 766 predominantly ethnic-minority students from 10 middle schools in southeast Texas in 2004 for a group randomized trial of IYG. We estimated logistic regression models, and the primary outcome was emotional and physical dating violence perpetration and victimization by ninth grade. Results. Control students had significantly higher odds of physical dating violence victimization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20, 1.92), emotional dating violence victimization (AOR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.36, 2.24), and emotional dating violence perpetration (AOR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.11, 2.26) than did intervention students. The odds of physical dating violence perpetration were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Program effects varied by gender and race/ethnicity. Conclusions. IYG significantly reduced 3 of 4 dating violence outcomes among ethnic-minority middle school youths. Although further study is warranted to determine if IYG should be widely disseminated to prevent dating violence, it is one of only a handful of school-based programs that are effective in reducing adolescent dating violence behavior.  MP: BACKGROUND Schools in the United States are increasingly being urged to address the problem of adolescent dating violence (DV) with their students. Given the limited time available to implement prevention programming during the school day, brief programs are needed. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a widely disseminated, brief community-based DV prevention program in partnership with a nonprofit community agency.  METHODS We conducted a randomized waitlist control trial of a 5-session DV prevention program (active condition) compared to health class as usual (waitlist control condition). Participants were 225 10th-grade students with a recent dating history in a large public school in New England. Surveys were administered at baseline, end of program, and 3 months postintervention.  RESULTS After completing the program, students in the active condition reported significantly lower approval of aggression, healthier dating attitudes, and more DV knowledge. These effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up. In addition, students in the active condition reported significantly less emotional/verbal and total DV perpetration and victimization at 3-month follow-up.  CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that a brief, community-based DV prevention curriculum can promote change in behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge among high school students.  MP: Objective: Teen dating violence is a serious public health problem. A cluster-randomized trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of Teen Choices, a 3-session online program that delivers assessments and individualized guidance matched to dating history, dating violence experiences, and stage of readiness for using healthy relationship skills. For high-risk victims of dating violence, the program addresses readiness to keep oneself safe in relationships. Method: Twenty high schools were randomly assigned to the Teen Choices condition (n = 2,000) or a Comparison condition (n = 1,901). Emotional and physical dating violence victimization and perpetration were assessed at 6 and 12 months in the subset of participants (total n = 2,605) who reported a past-year history of dating violence at baseline and/or who dated during the study. Results: The Teen Choices program was associated with significantly reduced odds of all 4 types of dating violence (adjusted odds ratios ranging from .45 to .63 at 12 months follow-up). For 3 of the 4 violence outcomes, participants with a past-year history of that type of violence benefited significantly more from the intervention than students without a past-year history. Conclusions: The Teen Choices program provides an effective and practicable strategy for intervention for teen dating violence prevention.  MP: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a dating violence (DV) prevention program for Cuban American adolescents (JOVEN/YOUTH: Juntos Opuestos a la Violence Entre Novios/Together Against Dating Violence). A randomized-controlled experimental design with a delayed condition was used to evaluate the effects on DV victimization and perpetration (N = 82). Self-administrated assessments were completed at baseline, 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after the intervention to assess for psychological victimization and perpetration and physical and sexual victimization and perpetration. Effect sizes were estimated, and generalized estimating equations were generated to test intervention effects over time and potential gender interactions. The intervention had medium to strong effects on DV victimization and perpetration for male participants but not for females. However, intervention effects were not statistically significant over time. More research is needed to enhance intervention effects of JOVEN on DV outcomes and to evaluate these effects among a larger and more diverse sample.  MP: This study presents the first evaluation of Dat-e Adolescence, a dating violence prevention program aimed at adolescents in Spain. A cluster randomized control trial was used involving two groups (a control group and experimental group) and two waves (pre-test and post-test six months apart). 1,764 students from across seven state high schools in Andalucía (southern Spain) participated in the study (856 in the control group and 908 in the experimental group); 52.3% were boys (n = 918), with ages ranging from 11 to 19 years (average age = 14.73; SD = 1.34). Efficacy evaluation was analyzed using Latent Change Score Models and showed that the program did not impact on physical, psychological or online aggression and victimization, nor did it modify couple quality. It was, however, effective at modifying myths about romantic love, improving self-esteem, and improving anger regulation, as a trend. These initial results are promising and represent one of the first prevention programs evaluated in this country. Future follow-up will allow us to verify whether these results remain stable in the medium term.  MP: This study assessed the initial feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an intervention aimed at reducing dating violence and sexual risk behavior in a sample of adolescent girls (ages 14–17) with prior exposure to physical dating violence (DV). One hundred and nine girls were randomly assigned to Date SMART (Skills to Manage Aggression in Relationships for Teens) or a Knowledge-only (KO) comparison group. Both intervention arms consisted of six, weekly 2-h sessions and one “booster” session 6 weeks later. Based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, the Date SMART intervention was designed to target common underlying skills deficits linked to both DV and sexual risk behavior in adolescent females: depression, self-regulation deficits, and interpersonal skills deficits. Assessments were administered at four time points (baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months). The Date SMART group was effective as reducing sexual DV involvement across the 9-month follow-up period. Both groups evidenced clinically meaningful reductions in physical, emotional, and digital DV involvement, total time in dating relationships, as well as reductions in depression. Findings indicate that delivering a DV and sexual risk prevention intervention to DV-affected adolescent girls is feasible and well-received. Furthermore, a skills-based approach that addresses the co-occurrence of DV and sexual risk behavior may be particularly useful for promoting reductions of sexual DV among high-risk adolescent girls. A future, large-scale trial with an inactive comparison condition is needed to evaluate the efficacy of Date SMART further.  MP: Objectives. To test the efficacy of Me & You, a multilevel technology-enhanced adolescent dating violence (DV) intervention, in reducing DV perpetration and victimization among ethnic-minority early adolescent youths. We assessed secondary impact for specific DV types and psychosocial outcomes.  Methods. We conducted a group-randomized controlled trial of 10 middle schools from a large urban school district in Southeast Texas in 2014 to 2015. We used multilevel regression modeling; the final analytic sample comprised 709 sixth-grade students followed for 1 year.  Results. Among the total sample, odds of DV perpetration were lower among intervention students than among control students (adjusted odds ratio = 0.46; 95% confidence interval = 0.28, 0.74). Odds of DV victimization were not significantly different. There were significant effects on some specific DV types.  Conclusions. Me & You is effective in reducing DV perpetration and decreasing some forms of DV victimization in early middle-school ethnic-minority students.  MP: Dating abuse (DA) is prevalent and consequential, yet there are no evidence-based interventions for the health care setting that prevent perpetration. The current study’s purpose was to test a one-session brief motivational interview-style intervention to decrease DA perpetration. We conducted a two-arm RCT of the Real Talk intervention with follow-up at 3 and 6 months. Participants were 172 youth ages 15–19 years old, recruited from the pediatric emergency department or outpatient care services of an urban hospital in the USA in 2014–2017. The primary outcome was change in self-reported DA perpetration, including subtypes of DA such as physical, sexual, psychological, and cyber DA. Youth in both intervention and control arms reduced DA perpetration over time. GEE models indicated no overall intervention effects for any, physical, sexual, or psychological DA. There were overall effects for cyber DA (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87). There were also effects at 3 months for psychological DA (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06, 0.93) and cyber DA (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19, 0.79). Analyses stratified by gender also found overall effects for males for any DA (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07, 0.55), physical DA (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10, 0.89), and cyber DA (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.27). For males, intervention effects on any DA persisted to 6 months (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 1.01). This health care-based one-session DA intervention is a potentially promising approach to reduce DA perpetration among adolescents.  MP: Despite high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) among teens who are pregnant or parenting, the field is lacking evidence-based prevention programs designed for this population. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively adapt the evidence-based Safe Dates IPV prevention program and conduct a pilot study of the adapted program with female teens who were pregnant or parenting. We completed formative research including a literature review, focus groups, and pre-testing of adapted content to inform the revised curriculum. We then conducted a randomized controlled trial with 32 teens (average age = 17) to compare the adapted program to the original program on implementation characteristics and outcomes, including IPV perpetration and victimization. Directions of effect favored the adapted program over the original program for 18 out of 21 implementation outcomes for which models could be estimated and for 11 of 12 participant outcomes. The strongest effects, all favoring the adapted program, were found for observer-reported adherence to the curriculum, participant ratings of the relevance of characters and scenarios, participant knowledge of ways to get help for abuse, and attitudes toward IPV. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted program for this target population and suggest that the program may be efficacious when evaluated in a larger study.  MP: This study evaluated a community-based intervention to help at-risk teens develop healthy, nonabusive relationships with dating partners. Participants were 158 14-16-year-olds with histories of child maltreatment who were randomly assigned to a preventive intervention group or a no-treatment control group. They completed measures of abuse and victimization with dating partners, emotional distress, and healthy relationship skills at bimonthly intervals when dating someone. Intervention consisted of education about healthy and abusive relationships, conflict resolution and communication skills, and social action activities. Growth curve analyses showed that intervention was effective in reducing incidents of physical and emotional abuse and symptoms of emotional distress over time. Findings support involvement of youths in reducing the cycle of violence as they initiate dating in midadolescence."
"Objective This study aims to quantitatively evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).  Methods The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases were searched for randomized controlled trails (RCTs) from their inception through July 10, 2021. RCTs that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study, and RevMan software was used for meta-analysis. Outcome indicators included scores on the fatigue severity scale (FSS), modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and the H/M amplitude ratio of the Soleus H reflex. When p < 0.05, the difference was considered significant.  Results A total of 10 articles were included in this study, with 8 of them in the quantitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed that the short-term effect of rTMS treatment for the MAS was better than that of the control treatment (95% CI: −1.27 to −0.25, p = 0.004); and compared with the control group, the effect of rTMS treatment for the H/M ratio showed a significant effect (95% CI: −0.12 to −0.03, p = 0.002); while the treatment effect for the FSS was not significant (95% CI: −4.87 to 1.28, p = 0.25).  Conclusion Our results provide preliminary evidence for the treatment of patients with MS by rTMS, especially for improving spasticity, but further research is needed to evaluate its effects on fatigue.","MP: Background: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) of the primary motor cortex improves transiently lower limbs spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the cerebral mechanisms underlying this effect have never been investigated. Objective: To assess whether modulation of spasticity induced by iTBS is underlined by functional reorganization of the primary motor cortices. Methods: A total of 17 patients with MS suffering from lower limbs spasticity were randomized to receive real iTBS or sham iTBS during the first half of a 5-week indoor rehabilitation programme. Spasticity was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale at baseline, after the stimulation session and at the end of the rehabilitation programme. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at the three time points, and brain functional networks topology was analysed using graph-theoretical approach. Results: At the end of stimulation, improvement of spasticity was greater in real iTBS group than in sham iTBS group (p = 0.026). iTBS had a significant effect on the balance of the connectivity degree between the stimulated and the homologous primary motor cortex (p = 0.005). Changes in inter-hemispheric balance were correlated with improvement of spasticity (rho = 0.56, p = 0.015). Conclusion: This longitudinal resting-state fMRI study evidences that functional reorganization of the primary motor cortices may underlie the effect of iTBS on spasticity in MS.  MP: Objective: To conduct a randomized, sham-controlled phase I/IIa study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of deep brain H-coil repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the primary motor cortex (MC) in patients with MS with fatigue or depression (NCT01106365). Methods: Thirty-three patients with MS were recruited to undergo 18 consecutive rTMS sessions over 6 weeks, followed by follow-up (FU) assessments over 6 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive high-frequency stimulation of the left PFC, MC, or sham stimulation. Primary end point was the safety of stimulation. Preliminary efficacy was assessed based on changes in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Randomization allowed only analysis of preliminary efficacy for fatigue. Results: No serious adverse events were observed. Five patients terminated participation during treatment due to mild side effects. Treatment resulted in a significant median FSS decrease of 1.0 point (95%CI [0.45,1.65]), which was sustained during FU. Conclusions: H-coil rTMS is safe and well tolerated in patients with MS. The observed sustained reduction in fatigue after subthreshold MC stimulation warrants further investigation.  MP: Objective: To investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modify spasticity. Methods: We used high-frequency (5 Hz) and low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS protocols in 19 remitting patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and lower limb spasticity. Results: A single session of 1 Hz rTMS over the leg primary motor cortex increased H/M amplitude ratio of the soleus H reflex, a reliable neurophysiologic measure of stretch reflex. Five hertz rTMS decreased H/M amplitude ratio of the soleus H reflex and increased corticospinal excitability. Single sessions did not induce any effect on spasticity. A significant improvement of lower limb spasticity was observed when rTMS applications were repeated during a 2-week period. Clinical improvement was long-lasting (at least 7 days after the end of treatment) when the patients underwent 5 Hz rTMS treatment during a 2-week protocol. No effect was obtained after a 2-week sham stimulation. Conclusions: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may improve spasticity in multiple sclerosis.  MP: Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease in the central nervous system which causes a number of physical symptoms including impairments of motor functions. Purpose: to investigate the effect of low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) on motor functions in multiple sclerosis patients. Methods: Thirty medically stable remitting relapsing MS patients aged between 20-40 years were randomly assigned into two groups (“A” study and “B” control). Both groups were treated with a selected physical therapy program consisting of graduated active exercises, balance and gait training, but only group “A” received (LF-rTMS) ipsilateral to the weaker lower limb, five times per week for two consecutive weeks. Isokinetic dynamometer measurements including peak torque (PT), peak torque/ body weight (PT/BW), time to peak torque (TPT), total work (TW) and average power (AP) of knee flexors and extensors plus lower extremity functional performance were measured and compared for both groups before and after intervention using biodex isokinetic dynamometer and Five Repetition Sit to Stand Test (5STS) respectively. Results: Comparison of the mean values of isokinetic dynamometer measurements post-treatment between both groups showed significant difference of (PT, PT/BW, TPT) in favor of group A(P ≤0.05) but no considerable variations were reported among both groups concerning (TW, AP) (P ˃ 0.05). Comparison of the mean values of (5STS) post-treatment between both groups showed significant difference in favor of group A (P ≤0.05). Correlation results revealed significant correlation between the tested Isokinetic dynamometer measurements and (5STS). Conclusion: low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve motor functions and subsequent functional performance in multiple sclerosis patients.  MP: Background and purpose The spasticity phenomenon is a significant factor in the development of disability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising treatment method for this disorder. Our aim was to compare the effects of two protocols of rTMS – the high-frequency (HF) rTMS (20 Hz) and the intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) – on the level of spasticity and concomitant symptoms in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with an analysis of the duration of the effects up to 12 weeks after the stimulation course.  Methods Thirty-four patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and lower spastic paraparesis were randomized into three groups: (i) HF-rTMS (20 Hz); (ii) iTBS; (iii) sham stimulation. Spasticity and spasticity-associated symptoms were assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale, the Subjective Evaluating Spasticity Scale (SESS), the numerical analog scale, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and the pain level scale.  Results The Modified Ashworth Scale was significantly reduced after the stimulation course in the HF-rTMS and iTBS groups. The SESS was reduced post-intervention and at the two follow-ups in the iTBS group, whilst HF-rTMS produced an SESS reduction only at the 2-week follow-up, with no effects in the sham group. Conversely, reduction in pain and fatigue was found in the HF-rTMS group.  Conclusions The results show that HF-rTMS and iTBS significantly reduce spasticity measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale, in contrast to sham stimulation. Some evidence was found in favor of a longer-lasting effect of iTBS on the SESS and of a reduction in pain and fatigue after HF-rTMS.  MP: Background and Purpose This randomized controlled study examined the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).  Methods This study included 16 patients with a history of MS and spasticity in the adductor hip muscles according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The participants were randomized into the active group (n=10) and control group (n=6), in which active rTMS and sham rTMS were applied in 10 sessions, respectively. A physical therapy and rehabilitation program was applied along with rTMS sessions in both groups. The evaluation parameters were assessed at baseline and then 1 week and 1 month after applying rTMS.  Results Statistical analyses with post-hoc correction revealed statistically significant improvements in the active group compared to the control group in the bilateral MAS score, Penn Spasm Frequency Scale score, patient satisfaction, amount of urine leakage, actual health status, perceived health status, energy and fatigue, role limitations due to physical problems, social function, overall quality of life, cognitive functioning, physical health composite score, mental health composite score, and total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) (p<0.05). Statistically significant changes were detected in the MSQOL-54 social function and physical health composite scores of patients in the control group (p<0.05).  Conclusions Active rTMS combined with a physical therapy program reduced spasticity in MS patients compared to the control group that received only physical therapy. Further comprehensive and more advanced studies are needed to confirm the present findings.  MP: Exercise therapy (ET) can be beneficial in disabled multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Intermittent transcranial magnetic theta burst stimulation (iTBS) induces long-term excitability changes of the cerebral cortex and may ameliorate spasticity in MS. We investigated whether the combination of iTBS and a program of ET can improve motor disability in MS patients. In a double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 30 participants were randomized to three different interventions: iTBS plus ET, sham stimulation plus ET, and iTBS alone. Before and after 2 weeks of treatment, measures of spasticity through the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and the 88 items Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Score questionnaire (MSSS-88), fatigue through the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), daily living activities (ADL) through the Barthel index and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through the 54 items Multiple Sclerosis Quality of life inventory (MSQoL-54) were collected. iTBS plus ET reduced MAS, MSSS-88, FSS scores, while in the Barthel index and MSQoL-54, physical composite scores were increased. iTBS alone caused a reduction of the MAS score, while none of the measured scales showed significant changes after sham iTBS plus ET. iTBS associated with ET is a promising tool for motor rehabilitation of MS patients.  MP: Background and purpose: Spasticity is a common disorder and a major cause of long-term disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Our aim was to evaluate whether a recently developed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, the intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is effective in modulating lower limb spasticity in MS patients.  Methods: Twenty MS patients were pseudorandomized to undergo a 2-week daily sessions of real or sham iTBS protocol. The H/M amplitude ratio of the Soleus H reflex, a reliable neurophysiological index of spinal excitability and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for spasticity were evaluated by blinded raters before and after the stimulation protocols.  Results: Patients receiving real iTBS showed a significant reduction of H/M amplitude ratio and MAS scores 1 week after the stimulation and persisting up to 2 weeks after the end of stimulation protocol. There were no significant effects for sham stimulation.  Conclusions: These results show that iTBS, a safe, non-invasive, well-tolerated and feasible protocol, is a promising tool for the treatment of spasticity in MS.  MP: Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability."
"We investigated whether the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to chemoradiation improves overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic searches in the databases of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science yielded 881 articles. Two reviewer authors independently selected 31 articles for full text review and deemed eight studies eligible for inclusion. Two were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a large (n = 609) matched-case study and the remaining were small retrospective cohort studies; in total 2150 patients. Risk of bias assessment showed that the RCTs were at low risk and all other studies were at high risk of bias. Pooled hazard ratios for OS and PFS were 0.78 (95%CI 0.45–1.33, p = 0.36) and 0.85 (95%CI 0.65–1.10, p = 0.22), respectively. Analysis stratified by study design and sensitivity analysis showed similar results. Funnel plots showed significant publication bias due to a lack of small studies with negative outcomes.","MP: The present study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) following concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation (CCRT) in patients with cervical cancer with lymphadenopathy (N1). A total of 37 patients with FIGO stage IB2-IVA cervical carcinoma with N1 (median age 57 years, range 31-74 years) were enrolled. External beam radiation therapy was followed by high-dose-rate brachytherapy. In cases of suspected para-aortic lymphadenopathy or common iliac lymph node involvement, extended radiotherapy fields were applied. Positive lymph nodes were externally radiated. Cisplatin was administered weekly at a dose of 30 mg/m2 during external beam radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy was administered to 17 patients and comprised carboplatin (6 mg/­ml/­min) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) administered monthly after CCRT, and repeated every 4 weeks for 3‑6 cycles. Over a median 21.5‑month follow‑up, no significant differences were found in the recurrence rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, or median interval to recurrence with N1 cervical cancer patients between the two groups. Patients with para-aortic lymphadenopathy who received CCRT and adjuvant chemotherapy had a more favorable overall and disease‑free survival than those treated with CCRT alone. However, 16/17 patients developed grade 3-4 leukopenia and 14/17 patients developed severe hematologic toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of full dose TC therapy after CCRT was not well tolerated in general and exhibited no benefit to N1 cervical cancer patients. However, it may be of therapeutic advantage over CCRT alone in cervical cancer patients with para-aortic lymphadenopathy.  MP: Objective To evaluated the oncologic outcomes associated with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Methods A total of 695 patients with FIGO stage IB2, IIA2, IIB-IVA LACC treated at 6 medical facilities were enrolled and divided into 2 groups: 478 were assigned to CCRT alone (CCRT group) and 217 to adjuvant chemotherapy after CCRT (CCRT-ACT group). The treatment outcomes were retrospectively compared and reported after the propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Results With a median follow-up of 56.4 months, no statistically significant differences were found in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and distance metastasis-free survival (DMFS) between 2 groups. In CCRT-ACT group, patients with lymph nodes involvement or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) had significantly longer DMFS, but no significant benefit in survival outcomes were observed with more than 2 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, patients with a high level of CA125 (>20.5U/mL) or SCC-Ag (>22.8μg/L) had a relatively better DFS or PFS, and grade 3-4 acute hematological toxicity, late urinary and lower gastrointestinal complications and diarrhea symptom were more frequent in CCRT-ACT group. Conclusions Adjuvant chemotherapy after CCRT has a potential role in further improving disease control for LACC patients with lymph nodal-metastasis or SCC with a high level of CA125 or SCC-Ag. Due to increased treatment-related complications and diarrhea symptom affecting the quality of life, post-CCRT adjuvant chemotherapy with excessive cycles was not be considered as the most appropriate choice in general.  MP: Background: Cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Standard treatment for locally advanced disease is chemoradiation. However, a significant percentage of women still relapse and die from the development of distant metastatic disease. OUTBACK was designed to determine the effects of giving adjuvant chemotherapy after chemoradiation on survival. Methods: OUTBACK is an international randomized phase III trial of the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG). Participating groups (countries) included ANZGOG (Australia and New Zealand), NRG (USA, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China), and Singapore. Eligible women had locally advanced cervical cancer (FIGO 2008 stage IB1 and node positive, IB2, II, IIIB or IVA) that was suitable for primary treatment with chemo-radiation with curative intent. Women were randomly assigned to either standard cisplatin-based chemo-radiation (control) or standard cisplatin-based chemo-radiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) with 4 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel, after stratification for nodal status, participating site, FIGO stage, age, and planned extended-field radiotherapy. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) at 5 years. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS); adverse events (AE); and patterns of disease recurrence. The target sample size of 900 provided 80% power with 95% confidence to detect an improvement in OS at 5 years from 72% (control) to 80% (ACT), with some over-accrual to account for non-compliance with ACT and loss to follow-up. Results: 919 of 926 women recruited from April 2011 to June 2017 were eligible and included in the primary analysis: 463 assigned ACT, 456 control. ACT was started in 361 (78%) women assigned to receive it. Median follow-up was 60 months (IQR 45-65). OS at 5 years was similar in those assigned ACT versus control (72% vs 71%, difference <1%, 95% CI -6 to +7; P = 0.91). The hazard ratio for OS was 0·91, (95% CI 0.70 to 1.18). PFS at 5 years was similar in those assigned ACT versus control (63% vs 61%, difference 2%, 95% CI -5 to +9; P = 0.61). The hazard ratio for PFS was 0·87, (95% CI 0.70 to 1.08). AE of grade 3-5 within a year of randomisation occurred in 81% who were assigned and received ACT versus 62% assigned control. There was no evidence of differences between treatment groups in AE beyond 1 year of randomisation. Patterns of disease recurrence were similar in the two treatment groups. Conclusions: Adjuvant chemotherapy given after standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation for women with locally advanced cervical cancer did not improve OS or PFS.  MP: Objective: To compare response rate and survivals of locally advanced stage cervical cancer patients who had standard concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) alone to those who had adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after CCRT. Methods: Patients aged 18–70 years who had International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB–IVA without para-aortic lymph node enlargement, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scores 0–2, and non-aggressive histopathology were randomized to have CCRT with weekly cisplatin followed by observation (arm A) or by ACT with paclitaxel plus carboplatin every 4 weeks for 3 cycles (arm B). Results: Data analysis of 259 patients showed no significant difference in complete responses at 4 months after treatment between arm A (n=129) and arm B (n=130): 94.1% vs. 87.0% (p=0.154) respectively. With the median follow-up of 27.4 months, 15.5% of patients in arm A and 10.8% in arm B experienced recurrences (p=0.123). There were no significant differences of overall or loco-regional failure. However, systemic recurrences were significantly lower in arm B than arm A: 5.4% vs. 10.1% (p=0.029). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 3-year overall survival (OS) of the patients in both arms were not significantly different. The hazard ratio of PFS and OS of arm B compared to arm A were 1.26 (95% CI=0.82–1.96; p=0.293) and 1.42 (95% CI=0.81–2.49; p=0.221) respectively. Conclusions: ACT with paclitaxel plus carboplatin after CCRT did not improve response rate and survival compared to CCRT alone. Only significant decrease of systemic recurrences with ACT was observed, but not overall or loco-regional failure.  MP: Introduction Standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) includes concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) that typically controls localized disease. However, most patients develop distant metastasis, ultimately leading to death.  Objective To determine the role of adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel for clinical outcomes in patients with LACC.  Methods Between 2010 and 2017, 109 patients with LACC were retrospectively evaluated. All patients received cisplatin (40 mg/m2) with concurrent external-beam radiotherapy (up to 50.4 Gy), followed by intra-cavitary brachytherapy. Forty-six of 109 patients received a median of six cycles (range 3–6 cycles) of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin (CRT + chemotherapy group; area under the curve 5). The remaining 63 patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (CRT group).  Results Disease-free survival and overall survival after a median follow-up of 24.5 months (range 2.6–94.75 months) were 93.5% and 95.7% and 69.8% and 82.5 % for the CRT + chemotherapy and CRT groups, respectively (p = 0.001, p = 0.012, respectively). No acute grade 3/4 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities were seen during CRT. During adjuvant chemotherapy, the most troublesome side effects were hematologic and neurologic toxicities; however, most were manageable. No chronic grade 3/4 genitourinary toxicities were seen.  Discussion Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with LACC significantly improved both disease-free survival and overall survival without increasing unmanageable toxicity. Future larger prospective trials are warranted to verify these findings.  MP: Objective:  Cervical cancer metastatic to the para-aortic lymph nodes (PALNs) carries a poor prognosis. Despite extended-field radiation therapy (EFRT), only 30% to 50% of patients will survive 3 years. We sought to examine the treatment regimens used, associated toxicities, and treatment outcomes in patients with cervical cancer metastatic to PALN.  Methods:  A retrospective review was performed of all patients with cervical cancer treated at a single institution between January 1, 2007 and November 1, 2014. Included patients had PALN metastases as the most distant site of disease, and all treatment plans were designated as curative. Excluded patients had other distant disease or treatment plans considered palliative. Standard treatment consisted of EFRT with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy.  Results:  Fifty-one of 344 patients (14.8%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age was 48.4 years. Forty-four patients received standard EFRT; 7 also received adjuvant platinum/taxane chemotherapy. Thirty-nine of 51 (76%) of patients achieved a complete response to primary treatment. Twelve of 51 (24%) had persistent disease or progression at the completion of treatment. Of responders, 15 of 39 (38%) recurred for an overall treatment failure rate of 27 of 51 (53%). Nineteen of 27 (70%) of treatment failures occurred outside the radiated field. Adjuvant chemotherapy following EFRT was not predictive of progression-free survival or overall survival. PALN diameter ≥1 cm was a significant negative prognostic indicator for overall survival.  Conclusions:  Over half of patients with cervical cancer metastatic to the PALN failed extended-field chemoradiation. Most failures occurred outside the radiated field suggesting PALN involvement is a surrogate marker of systemic disease. These findings underscore the need for effective systemic therapy, especially in patients with PALN ≥1 cm in size."
"Objectives This study investigated the prevalence and antibiotic resistance (AR) profiles of Campylobacter spp. isolated from animals, humans, and the environment in South Africa based on available published data.  Methods Original articles published from January 1, 1990 to January 1, 2021 were searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Africa Index Medicus, Scopus, and African Journal Online databases. Data were analyzed with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 3.0).  Results After screening, articles on animals (n = 25), humans (n = 7), environment (n = 3), animals/environment (n = 2), and a (n = 1) study on animals, humans, and the environment were included in this review. The pooled prevalence estimates (PPEs) were 28.8%, 16.4%, and 28.4% in animals, humans, and the environment, respectively. The Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli species were commonly isolated from humans, animals, and the environment in South Africa. The AR profiles were screened from 2032 Campylobacter spp., with the highest PPE of AR observed against clindamycin (76.9%) and clarithromycin (76.5%). Campylobacter isolates tested with the disk diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration methods recorded an overall AR prevalence of 35.3% and 37.1%, respectively, whereas multidrug resistance PPE was 35.3%.  Conclusion Regular surveillance of Campylobacter spp. prevalence and its antimicrobial resistance strains is recommended, as well as the formulation of a “One Health” approach for better management and control of Campylobacter spp. infection in South Africa.","MP: Campylobacter spp. are among the leading foodborne pathogens, causing campylobacteriosis, a zoonotic infection that results in bacterial gastroenteritis and diarrheal disease in animals and humans. This study investigated the molecular epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter spp. isolated across the farm-to-fork-continuum in an intensive pig production system in South Africa. Following ethical approval, samples were collected over sixteen weeks from selected critical points (farm, transport, abattoir, and retail) using a farm-to-fork sampling approach according to WHO-AGISAR guidelines. Overall, 520 samples were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter spp., which were putatively identified using selective media with identity and speciation confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of specific genes. Resistance profiles were ascertained by the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method. Antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were identified using PCR and DNA sequencing. Clonal relatedness was determined using ERIC-PCR. Altogether, 378/520 (72.7%) samples were positive for Campylobacter spp., with Campylobacter coli being the predominant species (73.3%), followed by Campylobacter jejuni (17.7%); 8.9% of the isolates were classified as “other spp”. Relatively high resistance was observed in C. coli and C. jejuni to erythromycin (89% and 99%), streptomycin (87% and 93%), tetracycline (82% and 96%), ampicillin (69% and 85%), and ciprofloxacin (53% and 67%), respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was noted in 330 of the 378 (87.3%) isolates. The antibiotic resistance genes observed were tetO (74.6%), blaOXA-61 (2.9%), and cmeB (11.1%), accounting for the resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin. The membrane efflux pump (cmeB), conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics, was also detected in most resistant isolates. Chromosomal mutations in gyrA (Thr-86-Ile) and 23S rRNA (A2075G and A2074C) genes, conferring quinolone and erythromycin resistance, respectively, were also found. Of the virulence genes tested, ciaB, dnaJ, pldA, cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and cadF were detected in 48.6%, 61.1%, 17.4%, 67.4%, 19.3%, 51%, and 5% of all Campylobacter isolates, respectively. Clonal analysis revealed that isolates along the continuum were highly diverse, with isolates from the same sampling points belonging to the same major ERIC-types. The study showed relatively high resistance to antibiotics commonly used in intensive pig production in South Africa with some evidence, albeit minimal, of transmission across the farm-to-fork continuum. This, together with the virulence profiles present in Campylobacter spp., presents a challenge to food safety and a potential risk to human health, necessitating routine surveillance, antibiotic stewardship, and comprehensive biosecurity in intensive pig production.  MP: Raw cow milk obtained from Fulani settlement in Ogun State, Nigeria was inoculated with pure cultures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermopilus with extract from Sodom apple leaf (Calotropis procera) as coagulant in the absence of rennin. Fermentation was done for four (4) days for the development of necessary aroma and coagulation. Physiochemical analysis of the fermenting sample showed a gradual drop in pH from 5.8-3.20 and an increase in total titratable acidity from 0.049-0.137%. Proximate analysis of the cheese sample showed a moisture, ash, fat, protein and carbohydrate (by difference) of 64, 0.60, 13.4, 12.86 and 9.14% respectively. Microbiological analysis of the cheese product revealed that the sample was completely free of coliforms, mould and yeasts and hence safe for consumption. This Sodom Apple produced cheese is hereby recommended for both growing children and adult due to the retention of a high percentage of protein after fermentation and its expected ability to correct protein deficiencies. The microbial production and nutritional analysis of the cheese sample is discussed.  MP: We investigated the prevalence, haemolytic activities and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of Campylobacter species isolated from pigs in three farms in the Venda region, Limpopo province, South Africa. During the period of investigation, which spanned over one year, 450 faeces samples from pigs comprising 150 each from the three farms were collected and appropriately transported to the base laboratory at the Department of Microbiology, University of Venda for analysis. In total, the prevalence rate of Campylobacter isolates from all three farms was 30.2%, whereas, the rates of 25 - 26% were recorded for farms X, Y and Z, respectively. Out of the isolated Campylobacter species 10 (12.5%) were identified as Campylobacter jejuni and 70(87.5%) as Campylobacter coli. Of the Campylobacter isolates from the farms, 23, 22 and 35 were β-haemolytic from farms X, Y and Z, respectively. Susceptibility of the isolates to 12 antibiotics was determined by disc diffusion technique. The overall rate of resistance determined in this study to most of the antibiotics was 84.2%. Most Campylobacter isolates from farm X (< 50%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, cefexime, and erythromycin, while > 50% were resistant to tetracycline, (54.5%) to vancomycin, (100%) to ampicillin and methicillin. The rates of resistance to these antibiotics were not significantly different from farms X and Y (p < 0.005). However, most isolates from farm Y were more resistant to ciprofloxacin (57.1%) than isolates from farm X (36.4%) and Z (40.7%). Resistance rates to tetracycline by C. coli isolated from farm Y (48%), farm Z (45.5%) and farm X (44.4%) were noted. Similar trend was observed for C. coli from farm Y (40%), farm Z (31.8%) and farm X (22.2%) for ciprofloxacin. All C. coli from farm Z showed higher level of resistance to ampicillin (100%), Y (64%) and X (55.6%). The C. jejuni isolates though few were markedly resistant to fluoroquinolone and the macrolide as well as aminoglycoside antibiotics. Most of the isolates were resistant to at least seven (7) of the antibiotics tested. These observations indicate high levels of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in the swine industry (erythromycin and tetracycline) among the C. coli and C. jejuni isolates from pigs. Erythromycin and ciprofloxacin are drugs for treatment of human campylobacteriosis. The high prevalence rate of resistance to these drugs among C. coli and C. jejuni isolates from pig faeces is of public health significance.  MP: A total of 200 freshly voided goat faeces samples were collected in the study and were examined for the presence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. The samples were obtained randomly from 2 farm settlements in Venda region, South Africa in 2008 to 2009. All samples were analyzed with the mCCDA media withCampylobacter supplement in microaerophilic condition provided by the Campygen gas envelope (Oxoid). Of the total 200 samples, the recovery rate was 29% (58 of 200) for all samples. Of the 200 samples, 155 (77.5%) were non-diarrheic and 45 (22.5%) were diarrheic faeces. From the 45 diarrheic faces, 41 (91.1%) were positive for campylobacters and of the 155 non-diarrheic faeces, 17 (11.1%) were positive for campylobacters. In all, 58 Campylobacter species comprising 33 (56.9%) Campylobacter jejuni and 8 (13.9%) Campylobacter coli strains were from diarrheic and 2 (3.4%) C. jejuni and 15 (25.9%) C. coli were from non-diarrheic faeces. There was no statistical correlation between the incidence of C. jejuni in diarrheic faeces and non-diarrheic faeces. Rate of resistance of C. jejuni and C. colito six regularly used antibiotics in human and veterinary campylobacteriosis; ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid and erythromycin were 40.0, 47.1%, 57.1, 43.5%, 48.6, 56.5%, 42.9, 43.5%, 34.3, 34.5% and 14.3, 17.4%, respectively. In comparison, a significantly higher frequency of resistance to gentamycin was recorded among the C. jejuni and C. coli isolates (57.1 versus 43.5%) respectively, at p < 0.005 from goats in all farms. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and kanamycin was higher among the C. coli than C. jejuni strains but the difference was not statistically significant. Comparable occurrences of resistance were observed among C. jejuni and C. coli to erythromycin and nalidixic acid. High prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in goat could be of public health significance in the Venda region. The observed multi-drug resistance and especially resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones in this study pose a threat of transfer of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens because of the close contact between goats and man.  MP: Background and Aim: Infections with Campylobacter species have gained recognition as the most frequent cause of foodborne gastroenteritis globally. Their significance in South Africa is still an area of study interest. This study was, therefore, carried out to determine the occurrence of Campylobacter species in chickens from North West Province of South Africa as well as their antibiotic sensitivity status.  Materials and Methods: A total of 2400 chicken fecal samples were collected and pooled to a total of 480 samples from five registered active poultry abattoirs in the Ngaka Modiri Molema District of North West Province, South Africa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of Campylobacter spp. targeting the 16S rRNA gene while antibiotic sensitivity was determined using disk diffusion inhibition test.  Results: After isolation, a total of 26 samples were confirmed to be harboring Campylobacter jejuni by PCR and sequencing. C. jejuni was found to be the only isolate detected in all the fecal samples tested. The study further demonstrated that C. jejuni infections were highest in the summer season (3%) followed by autumn and winter at 1%, while there were none detected in the spring. The isolated C. jejuni-positive samples on disk diffusion inhibition test displayed resistance to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin at 98%, 80%, 83%, and 21%, respectively.  Conclusion: C. jejuni isolated in this study is known to cause disease in humans, and thus its occurrence requires application of ""One Health"" strategy to reduce the spread of this zoonotic pathogen in South Africa.  MP: Campylobacter is a foodborne pathogen found in the gut of poultry and other animals, which thereby act as reservoirs for human infection. Campylobacter produces various virulence factors which contribute to the establishment of disease. The aim of this study was to detect virulence genes in Campylobacter isolated from chicken faeces. A total of 408 poultry cloacal samples were analysed through culture, PCR and DNA sequencing. Campylobacter were detected in 24 (5.9 %) of the samples, of which 21 were C. jejuni while 3 were C. coli. The cdtB gene was detected in all Campylobacter isolates while cdtA and cdtC genes were detected in 20 (83.3%) and 18 (75.0%) of the isolates, respectively. The cadF gene was detected in 18 (85.7%) C. jejuni but not in C. coli. Eight genotypes designated G1 to G8 were detected among the isolates. Genotypes G1 and G7 possessed all three cdt genes, a potential for producing functionally active toxins. A large proportion (70.8%) of the isolates possessed both genes for toxin production and adhesion. The high prevalence of cdt and cadF genes in Campylobacter species in this study indicates the pathogenic potential of the isolates. There is a need to implement control measures to curb the spread of these virulent strains.SIGNIFICANCE: •Virulent thermophilic campylobacters cause severe health complications in humans. •Although chicken meat is the main source of human infections, there is limited data on the occurrence of Campylobacter in chicken faeces in southern Africa. •This study adds to literature on the occurrence of virulent strains of Campylobacter species, notably through the deposition of the DNA sequences of our local strains into GenBank®. •Communal chickens may serve as a source of virulent thermophilic campylobacters to humans, resulting in serious public health implications  MP: Raw meats are sometimes contaminated with Campylobacter species from animal faeces, and meats have repeatedly been implicated in foodborne infections. This study evaluated the prevalence, virulence genes, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and resistance gene determinants in Campylobacter species isolated from retailed meat carcasses. A total of 248 raw meat samples were collected from butcheries, supermarkets, and open markets; processed for enrichment in Bolton broth; and incubated at 42 °C for 48 h in 10% CO2. Thereafter, the broths were streaked on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) plates and incubated at the same conditions and for the same amount of time. After incubation, colonies were isolated and confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide sequences used for the identification of the genus Campylobacter, species, and their virulence markers. The patterns of antimicrobial resistance profiles of the identified isolates were studied by disk diffusion method against 12 antibiotics, and relevant resistance genes were assessed by PCR. From culture, 845 presumptive Campylobacter isolates were obtained, of which 240 (28.4%) were identified as genus Campylobacter. These were then characterised into four species, of which C. coli had the highest prevalence rate (22.08%), followed by C. jejuni (16.66%) and C. fetus (3.73%). The virulence genes detected included iam (43.14%), cadF (37.25%), cdtB (23.53%), flgR (18.63%), and flaA (1.96%), and some of the isolates co-harboured two to four virulence genes. Of the 12 antibiotics tested, the highest phenotypic resistance displayed by Campylobacter isolates was against clindamycin (100%), and the lowest level of resistance was observed against imipenem (23.33%). The frequency of resistance genes detected included catll (91.78%), tetA (68.82%), gyra (61.76%), ampC (55%), aac(3)-IIa (aacC2)a (40.98%), tetM (38.71%), ermB (18.29%), tetB (12.90%), and tetK (2.15%). There is a high incidence of Campylobacter species in meat carcasses, suggesting these to be a reservoir of campylobacteriosis agents in this community, and as such, consumption of undercooked meats in this community is a potential health risk to consumers.  MP: Objectives Campylobacter jejuni isolated from broiler and layer chickens from registered abattoirs in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were tested for their susceptibility to eight antibiotics.  Methods Using agar dilution, susceptibility to eight antibiotics was determined for C. jejuni recovered from the caeca.  Results A total of 155 isolates were collected of which 77 were identified as C. jejuni (broilers n = 56 and layers n = 21). Resistance was highest to tetracycline (broilers 98.2% and layers 100%) and ceftriaxone (broilers 96.4% and layers 100%). High susceptibility was found to ciprofloxacin (broilers 91% and layers 76%) and gentamicin (broilers 98% and layers 81%). Susceptibilities to each of the antibiotics for the broilers and layers, respectively, were: 50% and 57% for erythromycin, 45% and 24% for clarithromycin, 68% and 43% for ampicillin and 64% and 48% for nalidixic acid. Statistically significant differences were detected for the MIC50 of gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline between broilers and layers (P < 0.001) with the MIC90 of gentamicin also of significant difference (P = 0.01). Multiresistance was detected in 23% and 43% of the isolates from broiler and layer chickens, respectively.  Conclusions Mass therapy procedures used in animal husbandry have a potential impact on antibiotic resistance development in C. jejuni.  MP: Campylobacter bacteria are important foodborne pathogens that cause acute diarrheal illness, and infection is often associated with contaminated poultry. In a blind observational study, the prevalence and resistance profiles of thermophilic Campylobacter strains collected from different poultry production systems were tested against the clinically used antibiotics ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and streptomycin. Campylobacter strains were isolated from chickens in rural production systems, a free-range commercial facility, and industrially raised broiler and egg-laying chickens all situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Isolates were collected from the chicken cecae and were identified with conventional methods and tested for antibiotic resistance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute agar dilution method. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. isolates in chickens was 68% (56 samples) in rural production, 47% (140 samples) in commercial free-range broilers, 47% (133 samples) in industrial broilers, and 94% (34 samples) in industrial layer hens. Isolates from the rurally raised chickens showed significantly (P < 0.01) less resistance against ciprofloxacin (7.9%), erythromycin (0%), and tetracycline (21.6%) than those from commercially produced chickens. Isolates from the commercially raised chickens (free range and industrial) were highly resistant to tetracycline (98.9 to 100%). The incidence of gentamicin and streptomycin resistance was 1.6 and 11.5%, respectively, in commercial free-range broilers, 1.7 and 16.4%, respectively, in industrially raised broilers, and 12.9 and 40%, respectively, in industrially raised layers. It is possible that variations among the poultry production systems, including antimicrobial usage, result in differences in antibiotic resistance profiles in Campylobacter.   MP: Reports on the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in dogs in South Africa are non-existent. This study investigated the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in 481 dogs visiting four rural community veterinary clinics in South Africa. Dogs were screened for Campylobacter spp. by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between sex, clinic, breed and age and the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in dogs. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. was 41.50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.39% – 46.04%). Campylobacter jejuni, C. upsaliensis and C. coli were detected in 29.31% (95% CI, 25.42% – 33.54%), 13.10% (95% CI, 10.37% – 16.42%) and 5.41% (95% CI, 3.71% – 7.82%) of dogs, respectively. Dogs carrying more than one species of Campylobacter spp. accounted for 6.23% (95% CI, 4.40% – 8.78%). Campylobacter upsaliensis and C. jejuni were detected in 3.74% (95% CI, 2.37% – 5.86%), whereas C. coli and C. jejuni were found in 2.49% (95% CI, 1.42% – 4.34%) of dogs. Age and clinic were the risk factors significantly associated with Campylobacter spp. occurrence, while age, breed and clinic were predictors of C. jejuni carriage. Furthermore, age was the only risk factor associated with a higher likelihood of carrying C. upsaliensis. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. C. jejuni and C. upsaliensis increased significantly as dogs grew older. In addition, the odds of carrying Campylobacter spp. were higher in the Staffordshire bull terrier breed compared to crossbreed dogs. In conclusion, this study shows that dogs visiting rural community veterinary clinics in South Africa are reservoirs of Campylobacter spp. and may be potential sources of Campylobacter spp. for humans living in close proximity of the dog populations under study.  MP: Trichomoniasis and campylobacteriosis are diseases caused by Trichomonas foetus and Campylobacter foetus respectively. These diseases pose economic losses due to infertility and abortion. The aim of this retrospective study was to estimate the prevalence of C. foetus and T. foetus among southern African cattle. Sheath washings and scrapings were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of these microorganisms. Out of 3, 458 samples that were tested for T. foetus, 142 (4.1%) were positive. Campylobacter foetus was detected in 60 of the 3, 161 (1.9%) samples. The use of PCR was convenient for estimatingthe prevalence of C. foetus and T. foetus.  MP: Two hundred and thirty-nine cattle from Gauteng Province in South Africa were tested for various pathogens causing reproductive diseases including bovine viral diarrhoea/mucosal disease (BVD/MD) virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV) virus, Neospora caninum and Brucella abortus using various tests. For BVD/MD virus, 49.37 % tested positive, 74.47 % for IBR/IPV virus, 8.96 % for Neospora caninum and 3.8 % for Brucella abortus. The result for Brucella abortus is higher than the national average, possibly due to the small sample size. A high seroprevalence of antibodies to both BVD/MD virus and IBR/IPV virus was evident. These 2 viruses should be considered, in addition to Brucella abortus, when trying to establish causes of abortion in cattle. The clinical significance of Neospora caninum as a cause of abortion in Gauteng needs further investigation. One hundred and forty-three bulls were tested for Campylobacter fetus and Trichomonas fetus, and a low prevalence of 1.4 % and 2.1 % respectively was found in this study. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.  MP: To assess post-evisceration contamination of broiler carcasses, 300 samples were randomly selected during routine slaughter in the winter of 2004. The samples originated from 50 chicken carcasses, taken directly after evisceration, as well as 25 samples from ready-to-sell packages of fresh intestines (mala) and livers. The samples were taken in batches over a period of 4 weeks to allow randomised sampling from different farms of origin. Conventional culture-based detection methods of Campylobacter spp. usually need 4-6 days to produce a result. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used for this study took less than 32 hours. The average contamination rates with Campylobacter in both the skin and liver samples were 24 %, and 28%for intestines. Chicken and chicken products, especially livers and intestines, forman integral part of the traditional diet of many Black South Africans, as they are cheap and readily available in bulk and un-chilled for direct distribution, mainly through street vending and other informal retail outlets. This sudy showed that Campylobacter spp. are prevalent in poultry in South Africa. The handling of poultry meat and products contaminated with this organism in households and the potential for cross-contamination of other foods presents a high risk of infection to consumers in South Africa. The study also emphasised the need for further research in this field.  MP: Consumption of food that is contaminated by microorganisms, chemicals, and toxins may lead to significant morbidity and mortality, which has negative socioeconomic and public health implications. Monitoring and surveillance of microbial diversity along the food value chain is a key component for hazard identification and evaluation of potential pathogen risks from farm to the consumer. The aim of this study was to determine the microbial diversity in meat and meat products from different enterprises and meat types in South Africa. Samples (n = 2017) were analyzed for Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium botulinum using culture-based methods. PCR was used for confirmation of selected pathogens. Of the 2017 samples analyzed, microbial ecology was assessed for selected subsamples where next generation sequencing had been conducted, followed by the application of computational methods to reconstruct individual genomes from the respective sample (metagenomics). With the exception of Clostridium botulinum, selective culture-dependent methods revealed that samples were contaminated with at least one of the tested foodborne pathogens. The data from metagenomics analysis revealed the presence of diverse bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The analyses provide evidence of diverse and highly variable microbial communities in products of animal origin, which is important for food safety, food labeling, biosecurity, and shelf life limiting spoilage by microorganisms.

"Background Previous reviews reported that the effects of CoQ10 on glycemic control were inconsistent. There is no review exploring the optimal intake of CoQ10 for glycemic control. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of CoQ10 on glycemic control and evaluate the dose–response relationship via integrating the existing evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs).  Methods Databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify RCTs for investigating the efficacy of CoQ10 on fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR up to March 12, 2022. We performed a meta-analysis on 40 RCTs of CoQ10. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes. Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE. Dose-response relationships were evaluated using 1-stage restricted cubic spline regression model. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021252933).  Findings Forty studies (n = 2,424 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. CoQ10 significantly reduced fasting glucose (WMD: -5.22 [95% CI: -8.33, -2.11] mg/dl; P <0.001; I2=95.10%), fasting insulin (-1.32 [-2.06, -0.58] μIU/ml; P < 0.001; I2=78.86%), HbA1c (-0.12% [-0.23, -0.01]; P =0.04; I2=49.10%), and HOMA-IR (-0.69 [-1.00, -0.38]; P <0.001; I2=88.80%). The effect of CoQ10 on outcomes was greater in diabetes with lower heterogeneity. A “U” shape dose-response relationship curve revealed that 100-200 mg/day of CoQ10 largely decreased fasting glucose (χ2 = 12.08, Pnonlinearity =0.002), fasting insulin (χ2 = 9.73, Pnonlinearity =0.008), HbA1c (χ2 = 6.00, Pnonlinearity =0.049), HOMA-IR (χ2 = 25.89, Pnonlinearity <0.001).  Interpretation CoQ10 supplementation has beneficial effects on glycemic control, especially in diabetes, and 100-200 mg/day of CoQ10 could achieve the greatest benefit, which could provide a basis for the dietary guidelines of CoQ10 in patients with glycemic disorders.

In man the quinone ring originates from tyrosine, while the formation of the polyisoprenoid lateral chain starts from acetyl CoA and proceeds through mevalonate and isopentenylpyrophosphate; this biosynthetic pathway is the same as the cholesterol one. We therefore performed this study to evaluate whether statins (hypocholesterolemic drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) modify blood levels of ubiquinone. Thirty unrelated outpatients with primary hypercholesterolemia (IIa phenotype) were treated with 20 mg of simvastatin for a 3-month period (group S) or with 20 mg of simvastatin plus 100 mg CoQ10 (group US). The following parameters were evaluated at time 0, and at 45 and 90 days: total plasma cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, Apo A1, Apo B and CoQ10 in plasma and in platelets. In the S group, there was a marked decrease in total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and in plasma CoQ10 levels from 1.08 mg/dl to 0.80 mg/dl. In contrast, in the US group we observed a significant increase of plasma CoQ10 (from 1.20 to 1.48 mg/dl) while the hypocholesterolemic effect was similar to that observed in the S group. Platelet CoQ10 also decreased in the S group (from 104 to 90 ng/mg) and increased in the US group (from 95 to 145 ng/mg). This study demonstrated that simvastatin lowered both low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and Apo B plasma levels and plasma and platelet levels of CoQ10, and that CoQ10 prevent both plasma and platelet CoQ10 reduction, without affecting the hypocholesterolemic effect of simvastatin.  MP: A possible relationship between the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency has been proposed. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of CoQ10 on metabolic control in 23 type 2 diabetic patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Treatment with CoQ10 100 mg bid caused a more than 3-fold rise in serum CoQ10 concentration (p<0.001). No correlation was observed between serum CoQ10 concentration and metabolic control. No significant changes in metabolic parameters were observed during CoQ10 supplementation. The treatment was well tolerated and did not interfere with glycemic control, therefore CoQ10 may be used as adjunctive therapy in patients with associated cardiovascular diseases.  MP: Aim: To investigate the effect of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) on glycaemic control and insulin requirement in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: We investigated 34 patients with Type 1 DM in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients received either 100mg Q10 or placebo daily for 3 months. The insulin doses were adjusted according to patient's home measurements of blood glucose concentrations and reported experience of hypoglycaemia. Results: At randomizafion no differences existed between the Q10 and the placebo groups in age, body mass index (BMI), HbA(1c), daily insulin dose or mean daily blood glucose concentration. Serum Q10 concentration increased in the Q10 group (mean ± SD: 0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 2.0 ± 1.0 μg/ml, P < 0.005), with no change in the placebo group (0.9 ± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.3 μg/ml, not significant (NS)). Following intervention no differences existed between the Q10 and the placebo groups regarding HbA(1c) (7.86 ± 0.88 vs. 7.84 ± 0.84%), mean daily blood glucose concentrations (8.06 ± 1.86 vs. 8.53 ± 1.88mM), mean insulin dose (52.1 ± 12.2 vs. 52.6 ± 21.4 U), hypoglycaemic episodes (2.0 ± 1.8 vs. 2.5 ± 2.1 episodes week), or cholesterol concentrations (4.81 ± 0.91 vs. 4.78 ± 1.07 mM). Furthermore, no differences existed in the well-being of the patients reported from a visual analogue scale (physical: 0.67 ± 0.21 vs. 0.71 ± 0.18, psychological: 0.70 ± 0.25 vs. 0.73 ± 0.24). Conclusion: Q10 treatment does not improve glycaemic control, nor does it reduce insulin requirement, and it can therefore be taken by patients with Type 1 DM without any obvious risk of hypoglycaemia. No major beneficial or unfavourable effects on the investigated parameters could be demonstrated and no major changes in the sense of well-being occurred in the patients.  MP: Objective: To examine the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on serum lipoprotein(a) in patients with acute coronary disease. Study Design: Randomized double blind placebo controlled trial. Subjects and Methods: Subjects with clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, angina pectoris (based on WHO criteria) with moderately raised lipoprotein(a) were randomized to either coenzyme Q10 as Q-Gel (60 mg twice daily) (coenzyme Q10 group, n=25) or placebo (placebo group, n=22) for a period of 28 days. Results: Serum lipoprotein(a) showed significant reduction in the coenzyme Q10 group compared with the placebo group (31.0% vs 8.2% P<0.001) with a net reduction of 22.6% attributed to coenzyme Q10. HDL cholesterol showed a significant increase in the intervention group without affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and blood glucose showed a significant reduction in the coenzyme Q10 group. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation was also associated with significant reductions in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, malon/dialdehyde and diene conjugates, indicating an overall decrease in oxidative stress. Conclusion: Supplementation with hydrosoluble coenzyme Q10 (Q-Gel) decreases lipoprotein(a) concentration in patients with acute coronary disease.  MP: Objective: Our objective was to assess effects of dietary supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) on blood pressure and glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes, and to consider oxidative stress as a potential mechanism for any effects.  Subjects and design: Seventy-four subjects with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia were involved in a randomised double blind placebo-controlled 2×2 factorial intervention.  Setting: The study was performed at the University of Western Australia, Department of Medicine at Royal Perth Hospital, Australia.  Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of 100 mg CoQ twice daily (200 mg/day), 200 mg fenofibrate each morning, both or neither for 12 weeks.  Main outcome measures: We report an analysis and discussion of the effects of CoQ on blood pressure, on long-term glycaemic control measured by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and on oxidative stress assessed by measurement of plasma F2-isoprostanes.  Results: Fenofibrate did not alter blood pressure, HbA1c, or plasma F2-isoprostanes. There was a 3-fold increase in plasma CoQ concentration (3.4±0.3 µmol/l, P<0.001) as a result of CoQ supplementation. The main effect of CoQ was to significantly decrease systolic (−6.1±2.6 mmHg, P=0.021) and diastolic (−2.9±1.4 mmHg, P=0.048) blood pressure and HbA1c (−0.37±0.17%, P=0.032). Plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations were not altered by CoQ (0.14±0.15 nmol/l, P=0.345).  Conclusions: These results show that CoQ supplementation may improve blood pressure and long-term glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes, but these improvements were not associated with reduced oxidative stress, as assessed by F2-isoprostanes.  MP: Arteriopathy is the principal complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It develops from endothelial dysfunction, which we have hypothesised occurs in diabetes primarily as a consequence of dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress. Fenofibrate and CoQ may improve endothelial function by regulating dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress, respectively. We therefore aimed to assess the independent and combined effects of fenofibrate and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) on endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilator function of the forearm microcirculation in type 2 diabetes. Eighty dyslipidaemic type 2 diabetics were randomized to receive fenofibrate (200 mg/daily), CoQ (200 mg/daily), fenofibrate plus CoQ (200+200 mg daily), or placebo for 12 weeks. Forearm microcirculatory function was assessed with venous occlusion plethysmography during the infusion of acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin (BK), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) into the brachial artery. Blood flow responses were calculated as area under the curve (AUC). Fenofibrate significantly lowered plasma cholesterol, triglyceride and fibrinogen (P<0.001), and elevated HDL-cholesterol and homocysteine (P<0.001). CoQ did not change plasma isoprostanes, but significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and HbA1c (P<0.05). Fenofibrate plus CoQ significantly improved (P<0.05) the AUC for ACh, BK and SNP without significantly altering basal responses to l-NMMA. Fenofibrate or CoQ alone did not significantly alter blood flow responses. Improvements in blood flow were independent of changes in plasma lipids, blood pressure, homocysteine and isoprostanes, but were correlated (P=0.013) with HbA1c. In conclusion, in this factorial trial we found that only the combination of fenofibrate and CoQ markedly improved endothelial and non-endothelial forearm vasodilator function in dyslipidemic type 2 diabetic patients. The favourable vascular effect of this therapeutic combination could be due to increase in the bioactivity of and/or responses to endothelium-derived relaxing factors, including nitric oxide, and this may entail synergistic stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.  MP: The safety profile of Coenzyme Q10 (Kaneka Q10) at high doses for healthy subjects was assessed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Kaneka Q10 in capsule form was taken for 4 weeks at doses of 300, 600, and 900 mg/day by a total of eighty-eight adult volunteers. No serious adverse events were observed in any group. Adverse events were reported in 16 volunteers with placebo, in 12 volunteers with the 300 mg dose, in 20 volunteers with the 600 mg, dose and in 16 volunteers with the 900 mg dose. The most commonly reported events included common cold symptoms and gastrointestinal effects such as abdominal pain and soft feces. These events exhibited no dose-dependency and were judged to have no relationship to Kaneka Q10. Changes observed in hematology, blood biochemistry, and urinalysis were not dose-related and were judged not to be clinically significant. The plasma CoQ10 concentration after 8-month withdrawal was almost the same as that before administration. These findings showed that Kaneka Q10 was well-tolerated and safe for healthy adults at intake of up to 900 mg/day.  MP: PureSorb-QTM40 (water-soluble type CoQ10 powder, CoQ10 content is 40 w/w%; hereinafter referred to as P40) is reported in the single-dose human and rat studies to have a greater absorption rate and absorbed volume of CoQ10 even taken postprandially, than those of regular CoQ10, which is lipid-soluble and generally taken in the form of soft-gel capsules. Thus, it was anticipated that the serum CoQ10 level might be higher with P40 tablets than with soft-gel capsules, even for the same dose of CoQ10. In the present study, in order to confirm the safety and measure the serum CoQ10 level for the case of an excessive dose of P40, a double-blinded Placebo controlled comparative study was conducted on 46 healthy volunteers and they were randomly divided into two groups. The P40 tablets or placebo were repeatedly taken by the volunteers. As the result of the study, for the group of taking 2,250 mg/d of P40 (that is, 900 mg/d of CoQ10) for 4 consecutive wk, the serum CoQ10 level peaked at 2 wk after the start of intake at 8.79±3.34 μg/mL, and at 4 wk, it was at the level of 8.33±4.04 μg/mL. At 2 wk from withdrawal of intake, the serum CoQ10 level decreased to 1.30±0.49 μg/mL. The serum CoQ10 levels at these three points were significantly higher than those of the first day of intake and the Placebo group, which had no significant change throughout the study. Furthermore, P40 intake did not cause any significant changes in symptoms or clinical laboratory results as assessed by physical, hematological, blood biochemical or urinalysis tests. Physician examinations also did not reveal any abnormalities. These results confirm that P40 is an extremely safe material and it can produce better absorption of CoQ10.  MP: Background and objective Chronic kidney disease (CKD) associates with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Hypertension is a major determinant of progression of CKD. Omega-3 fatty acids (ω3FA) protect against CVD via improvements in blood pressure, heart rate, vascular reactivity and serum lipids. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) may improve blood pressure and vascular function. This study determined whether ω3FA and CoQ have independent or additive effects in improving the cardiovascular profile, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, in nondiabetic patients with CKD stages 3-4. Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention, patients were randomized to either ω3FA (4g), CoQ (200 mg), both supplements or control (4g), daily for 8 weeks. Results Eighty-five patients aged 56.5 ±1.4 years; BMI 27.3 ± 0.5 kg/m2; supine blood pressure 125.0/72.3 mmHg; and glomerular filtration rate 35.8 ± 1.2 ml/min/1.73 m2, were randomized. Seventy-four completed the study. ω3FA, but not CoQ, reduced 24-h ambulatory heart rate (P<0.0001) and blood pressure (P<0.0001). Main effects for ω3FA on 24-h measurements were -3.3 ±0.7/-2.9 ±0.5 mmHg and -4.0±0.5bpm. Postintervention blood pressure showed significant interactions between treatments. ω3FA reduced triglycerides 24% (P<0.001). There were no changes in glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin or total protein excretion, cholesterol, HDLcholesterol (C), LDL-C, glucose, insulin, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Conclusion This study has shown that ω3FA reduce blood pressure, heart rate and triglycerides in patients with CKD. CoQ had no independent effect on blood pressure but increased heart rate. These results show that ω3FA lower blood pressure and may reduce cardiovascular risk in nondiabetic patients with moderate-to-severe CKD.  MP: Aims Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ) supplementation, which is an obligatory coenzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory transport chain, can reverse MD and improve endothelial function in patients with ischaemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).  Methods and results We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effects of CoQ supplement (300 mg/day, n = 28) vs. placebo (controls, n = 28) for 8 weeks on brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients with ischaemic LVSD(left ventricular ejection fraction <45%). Mitochondrial function was determined by plasma lactate/pyruvate ratio (LP ratio). After 8 weeks, CoQ-treated patients had significant increases in plasma CoQ concentration (treatment effect 2.20 μg/mL, P < 0.001) and FMD (treatment effect 1.51%, P = 0.03); and decrease in LP ratio (treatment effect −2.46, P = 0.03) compared with controls. However, CoQ treatment did not alter nitroglycerin-mediated dilation, blood pressure, blood levels of fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and oxidative stress as determined by serum superoxide dismutase and 8-isoprostane (all P > 0.05). Furthermore, the reduction in LP ratio significantly correlated with improvement in FMD (r = −0.29, P = 0.047).  Conclusion In patients with ischaemic LVSD, 8 weeks supplement of CoQ improved mitochondrial function and FMD; and the improvement of FMD correlated with the change in mitochondrial function, suggesting that CoQ improved endothelial function via reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with ischaemic LVSD.  MP: This study investigated the effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on metabolic parameters, inflammatory markers, arterial stiffness, and fatigue in obese subjects. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study on 51 obese subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2. Subjects were randomized into either a coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) group (n = 26, BMI = 27.9 ± 2.3 kg/m2, age = 42.7 ± 11.3 years) or a placebo group (n = 25, BMI = 26.8 ± 2.8 kg/m2, age = 41.3 ± 11.2 years) for a 12-week study. We collected anthropometric measurements, blood for laboratory testing, brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) as an indicator of arterial stiffness, and responses to a fatigue severity scale (FSS) questionnaire at the initial (0 week) and final (12 weeks) visits. A total of 36 subjects successfully completed the study protocol. Serum coenzyme Q10 levels increased significantly from 0.65 ± 0.27 μg/mL to 1.20 ± 0.38 μg/mL in the coenzyme Q10 group (P < .001). Oral administration of coenzyme Q10 did not significantly affect lipid profiles, oxidative and inflammatory markers [including lipoprotein (a), oxidized low-density lipoprotein level, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count], or baPWV. The mean FSS score decreased significantly from 40.1 to 33.1 in the coenzyme Q10 group (P = .017), but no significant change was seen in the placebo group (P = .464). However, the extents of the change in mean FSS score between the placebo and coenzyme Q10 groups were not significantly different (P = .287). In conclusion, we found no evidence that coenzyme Q10 affects fatigue index, arterial stiffness, metabolic parameters, or inflammatory markers.  MP: Introduction Diabetic polyneuropathy aetiology is based on oxidative stress generation due to production of reactive oxygen species. Ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol and redistributed into lipoproteins, possibly to protect them from oxidation.  Aims To evaluate the impact of oral ubiquinone in diabetic polyneuropathy, and the role of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nerve growth factor (NGF-β).  Methods We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients were randomized to ubiquinone (400 mg) or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Main outcomes were clinical scores, nerve conduction studies, LPO, NGF-β and safety.  Results Twenty four patients on experimental group and twenty five on control group met the inclusion criteria (mean age 56 years, 22% male and 78% female, mean evolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus 10.7 years). Significant improvement on experimental vs control group was found in neuropathy symptoms score (from 2.5 ± 0.7 to 1 ± 0.8, p < 0.001), neuropathy impairment score (5.5 ± 4 to 3.1 ± 2.6, p < 0.001), sural sensory nerve amplitude (13.0 ± 6.1 to 15.8 ± 5.1 μV, p = 0.049), peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (39.7 ± 5.0 to 47.8 ± 4.9 m/s, p = 0.047), and ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity (48.8 ± 6.8 to 54.5 ± 6.1 m/s, p = 0.046). There was a significant reduction of LPO in subjects treated with ubiquinone vs placebo (16.7 ± 8.6 and 23.2 ± 15.8 nmol/mL, respectively) with p < 0.05, and NGF-β did not change (control 66.5 ± 26.7 vs. experimental 66.8 ± 28.4 pg/mL, p = 0.856). No drug-related adverse reactions were reported.  Conclusions Twelve weeks treatment with ubiquinone improves clinical outcomes and nerve conduction parameters of diabetic polyneuropathy; furthermore, it reduces oxidative stress without significant adverse events.  MP: Aim. Increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defense contribute to pathogenesis and progression of type 2 diabetes. Consistent with this fact, it has been shown that diabetic patients have reduced coenzyme Q10 level. In this study we sought to compare the effect of coenzyme Q10 versus placebo on glycemic control and lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 64 type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg Q 10 or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-C C HDL-C were measured. Results. In this study no significant differences considering age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes duration, FPG, HbA1c, TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C were shown between two groups. Serum HbA1c concentration decreased in the Q 10 treated group (8±2.28 vs. 8.61±2.47%) with no significant effect in the placebo group. Following intervention no differences have been shown regarding FPG, TG and HDL-C in Q10 treated group. Furthermore, mean differences of TC and LDL-C level were statistically altered between two groups (Pvalue=0.027 and 0.039 respectively). Conclusion. In this study, Q10 treatment improved glycemic control, total and LDL cholesterol but these differences were associated with no favourable effects on TG and HDL-C.  MP: Backgrounds and Aims Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver injury. Chronic exposure to oxidative stress leads to depletion of liver antioxidants and abnormal cytokine production; antioxidant therapy is one of the main therapeutic lines in NAFLD. In the current study we aimed to investigate the effect of coenzyme Q10 (coQ10) therapy on several adipocytokines and insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD.  Methods In the current randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial 44 NAFLD patients were enrolled. After randomization into two groups, 22 patients received 100 mg/day coQ10 capsules and 22 patients received placebo daily for 4 weeks. BMI and WHR were calculated for patients at the beginning and end of the study and blood samples were obtained from the patients to measure serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting serum glucose (FSG), insulin resistance (IR), vaspin, chemerin, pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and markers of oxidative stress including total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA).  Results After 4 weeks of coQ10 supplementation, waist circumference (WC) and serum AST and TAC concentrations significantly decreased in intervention group (p <0.05) but no significant changes occurred in placebo-treated group. In stepwise multivariate linear regression model, change in serum FSG was a significant predictor of changes in serum vaspin, chemerin and pentraxin 3 (p <0.001).  Conclusions The present study showed a potential for coQ10 therapy in improving several anthropometric and biochemical variables in NAFLD. Longer studies with higher doses of coQ10 are required to further evaluate this potential benefit."
"Objective To explore the protective effect and potential mechanisms of danshen root (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge., S. miltiorrhiza) and its extracts for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN).  Methods Preclinical studies of S. miltiorrhiza and its extracts on DN were systematically searched in nine databases. The primary outcomes were blood glucose, kidney function, proteinuria, and renal histopathology. The secondary outcomes included the related mechanisms. The methodological quality of animal studies was assessed based on the risk of bias tool of the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) for animal studies. Meta-analysis was performed using R software (version 4.1.2).  Results Twenty-nine animal experimental studies that met the eligibility criteria were included in this study. Compared to the control group, S. miltiorrhiza reduced the serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, 24-h urine protein, 24-h urine albumin, blood glucose, and kidney index (kidney weight/body weight), and alleviated renal pathological damage. In terms of the mechanism of action, compared to the control group, S. miltiorrhiza reduced the levels of transforming growth factor β1, collagen IV, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, and monocyte/macrophage (ED-1), and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, nuclear factor E2–related factor 2, and heme oxygenase-1.  Conclusion The existing evidence shows that S. miltiorrhiza has beneficial effects on the animal model of DN, and its mechanism is mainly related to improving kidney fibrosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response.","MP: Ethnopharmacological relevance Danshen Injection, the aqueous extracts of Radix Salvia miltiorrhiza (S. miltiorrhiza), is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese herbs in chronic renal failure treatment. In present study, the mechanism of the renoprotective effect of Danshen Injection was analyzed on streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods Diabetic experimental model was established in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Rats with blood glucose concentration of higher than 300 mg/dl were intraperitoneally administered with Danshen Injection at a dose of 0.78 ml/kg day. The blood glucose, 24 h urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), lipid peroxide (LPO), antioxidant enzyme of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and histomorphological changes in kidney of diabetic rats were analyzed during the course of Danshen Injection administration, as well as the tubular function index of albumin reabsorption of fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA). Results The intraperitoneal administration of Danshen Injection could ameliorate the physiological dysfunctions of increased 24 h urinary protein excretion((48.21±8.04)%), sCr((39.4±3.7)%), and BUN((43.37±6.74)%), alleviate the ultrastructural abnormalities of hypertrophy, matrix expansion, and fibrosis in glomerulus, decrease the TGF-β1 expression, AGEs and LPO accumulation, and increase the activity of SOD and GSH-Px in kidney of diabetic rats, but did not significantly influence the blood glucose. Besides these, the Danshen Injection administration also partly restored the decrease of megalin expression in tubules and reabsorptive function of FITC-BSA, in diabetic rats. Conclusion The renoprotection of Danshen Injection on diabetic rats was associated with the preservation of tubular function and structure from the hyperglycemia induced toxicities of inappropriate cytokines secretion, oxidative stress, advanced glycation stress, and megalin expression deletion.  MP: Oxidative stress and inflammation have been demonstrated to be involved in the onset and promotion of diabetic nephropathy (DN).Tanshinone IIA (Tan) possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, the aim of the present study was to explore whether Tan could attenuate renal damage in the rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes and its potential mechanisms. Tan was gavaged to STZ-induced diabetic rats at the dose of 10mg/kg once a day for 12 weeks. Tan treatment significantly attenuated albuminuria and renal histopathology in diabetic rats. Besides, Tan treatment also effectively inhibited oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Our study provided evidence that the protective effect of Tan on diabetes-induced renal injury is associated with inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. Tan may be a potential candidate for the treatment of DN.  MP: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the leading cause of end stage renal failure, and prevention or retardation of DN has become a major goal in biomedical research. In this study, Tanshinone IIA, a component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, was studied in experimental rats in which DN was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. The DN rats were treated with 10 mg/kg of Tanshinone IIA for 12 weeks to analyze its reno-protective effect with different parameters. Renal hypertrophy and 24-h urinary protein excretion were ameliorated by Tanshinone IIA. Moreover, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), angiotensin II (Ang II), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), collagen IV, and monocyte/macrophage (ED-1) either in the serum or kidney were significantly reduced. These results suggest that Tanshinone IIA might have protective effects on several pharmacological targets during the progression of DN, and could be a potential drug for the prevention of DN.  MP: Ethnopharmacological relevance: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end stage renal disease. In this study, the effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) were studied in an experimental rat model of DN that was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. Materials and methods: Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (290 ± 10 g) by injecting STZ (45 mg/kg) into the tail vein. After development of diabetes, the rats were treated with SM (500 mg/kg) for 8 weeks in order to analyze its renoprotective effect, which was evaluated by means of blood glucose level, urine protein, and the expression of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), collagen IV, and monocyte/macrophage (ED-1) infiltration. Results: High levels of 24-h urinary protein excretion were ameliorated by SM. Moreover, the serum and kidney levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and the kidney levels of collagen IV, monocytes/macrophages (ED-1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), were significantly reduced. Conclusions: These findings suggest that SM might inhibit the progression of DN and could be a therapeutic agent for regulating several pharmacological targets for treatment or prevention of DN.  MP: Shuangdan oral liquid (SDO) containing radix Salviae miltiorrhizae (Chinese name Danshen) and cortex moutan (Chinese name Mudanpi) is a traditional Chinese medicine using for treating vascular diseases. Danshensu (DSS) is a main effective monomer composition derived from radix Salviae miltiorrhizae and paeonol (Pae) from cortex moutan. Although the two herbs are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, the pharmacological functions of their active compositions were not reported. Therefore, the research of DSS and Pae in mechanisms and pharmacodynamics interaction can provide scientific evidence to support clinical application. The diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats which were induced by streptozotocin (STZ) were treated with SDO, DSS, Pae, and DSS+Pae for eight weeks. The positive effects on DN animal models were investigated by detection of physiological and biochemical indexes and oxidative stress markers, within five treatments: SDO, DSS, Pae, DSS+Pae and insulin group. Compared with the model group, the DSS+Pae group improved the renal function, blood lipid metabolism and blood viscosity, increased the vitality of T-SOD or T-AOC and decreased the level of MDA or NO after the treatment. The study was successfully showed that the DSS+Pae group could delay the process of DN, especially in the renal injury part of histopathology changes. Our results suggest that the co-administration of DSS and Pae significantly may play a protective role in DN rats through decreasing the oxidative stress and improving the blood lipid metabolism mechanisms.  MP: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most frequent complications in diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to explore whether Danshen injection is protective to renal tissue in diabetes. Intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes in rats. Some STZ-induced diabetic rats were also intraperitoneally injected with Danshen solution at two different dosages (0.5 or 1 ml/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Our results showed that serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen were significantly increased in STZ-induced diabetic rats, which was alleviated upon Danshen injection. Danshen injection was also found to ameliorate hypertrophy and dilatation of renal tubule and glomeruli possibly by decreasing the expression of collagen and fibronectin in association with suppression of TGF-β1/Smad pathway. Further investigation revealed that Danshen injection could increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats, indicating suppression of oxidative stress. In addition, we also found that Danshen injection could suppress IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway and reduce the level of a number of pro-inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the diabetic renal tissue, indicating suppression of inflammation. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that Danshen injection may rescue STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, possibly via suppressing the oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and fibrosis progression.  MP: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, which can be triggered by oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the renoprotective effect of the ethyl acetate extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza (EASM) on DN and examined the underlying molecular mechanism. We observed that EASM treatment attenuated metabolic abnormalities associated with hyperglycemic conditions in the experimental DN model. In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice, EASM treatment reduced albuminuria, improved renal function and alleviated the pathological alterations within the glomerulus. To mimic the hyperglycemic conditions in DN patients, we used high glucose (25mmol/L) media to stimulate mouse mesangial cells (MMCs), and EASM inhibited high glucose-induced reactive oxygen species. We also observed that EASM enhanced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which mediated the anti-oxidant response, and its downstream gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) with concomitant decrease of expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1) both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that EASM alleviates the progression of DN and this might be associated with activation of Nrf2.  MP: Background/Aims: Glomerular endothelium dysfunction leads to the progression of renal architectonic and functional abnormalities in early-stage diabetic nephropathy (DN). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) are proved to play important roles in diabetic nephropathy. This study investigated the role of Salvianolic acid A (SalA) on early-stage DN and its possible underlying mechanism. Methods: In vitro AGEs formation and breaking rate were measured to illustrate the effect of SalA on AGEs. Type 2 diabetic nephropathy rats were induced by high-fat diet and low-dose streptozocin (STZ). After eight-week treatment with SalA 1 mg/kg/day, 24h-urine protein, creatinine clearance was tested and renal structural injury was assessed by PAS and PASM staining. Primary glomerular endothelial cell permeability was evaluated after exposed to AGEs. AGEs-induced RhoA/ROCK and subsequently activated disarrange of cytoskeleton were assessed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Results: Biochemical assay and histological examination demonstrated that SalA markedly reduced endothelium loss and glomerular hyperfiltration, suppressed glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial matrix expansion, eventually reduced urinary albumin and ameliorated renal function. Further investigation suggested that SalA exerted its renoprotective effects through inhibiting AGE-RAGE signaling. It not only inhibited formation of AGEs and increased its breaking in vitro, but also reduced AGEs accumulation in vivo and downregulated RAGE expression. SalA restored glomerular endothelial permeability through suppressing AGEs-induced rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton via AGE-RAGE-RhoA/ ROCK pathway. Moreover, SalA attenuated oxidative stress induced by AGEs, subsequently alleviated inflammation and restored the disturbed autophagy in glomerular endothelial cell and diabetic rats via AGE-RAGE-Nox4 axis. Conclusion: Our study indicated that SalA restored glomerular endothelial function and alleviated renal structural deterioration through inhibiting AGE-RAGE, thus effectively ameliorated early-stage diabetic nephropathy. SalA might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.  MP: Purpose: Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a compound extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, can improve type II diabetes, while the molecular mechanisms underlying Tan IIA-mediated protective effects in diabetic nephropathy are unclear. This study explored the protective actions of Tan IIA on renal tissues in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nephropathy. Materials and Methods: Tan IIA (2, 4, 8 mg/kg/day) was daily administered to STZ-treated rats by intraperitoneal injection for 42 days. The morphologic pathology was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscopy. The protein expression levels in renal tissues were evaluated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry; the mRNA expression level was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Tan IIA at 2 and 4 mg/kg attenuated the increase in the levels of uric acid and blood urea nitrogen and restored the reduction in the superoxide dismutase activity in the serum of the diabetic rats. Tan IIA at 2 and 4 mg/kg, but not 8 mg/kg, ameliorated the thickening of renal tubule in the diabetic rats; Tan IIA at 2 and 4 and 8 mg/kg attenuated the thickening of glomerular basement membrane and the collagen deposition in the renal tissues of the diabetic rats. Tan IIA treatment at 2, 4, 8 mg/kg decreased the expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta1, TSP-1, Grp78 and CHOP in the diabetic rats. Tan IIA at 2 and 4 and 8 mg/kg attenuated the increase in the protein levels of p-PERK, p-elf2α and ATF-4 from the renal tissues of diabetic rats, while the protein level of AFT-6 and the mRNA expression levels of XBP-1t, XBP-1s and p58IPK in the renal tissues were not affected by STZ or Tan IIA treatment. Conclusion: Tan IIA-mediated protective effects on the STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy may be associated with the reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress via attenuating PERK signaling activities."

CPS-referred mothers participated in the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention or a control intervention. Mothers' event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured while they categorized images of children with crying, laughing, and neutral expressions. CPS-referred ABC mothers (n = 19) and low-risk comparison mothers (n = 30) showed a larger enhancement of ERP responses for emotional faces relative to neutral faces than CPS-referred control mothers (n = 21). Additionally, the magnitude of ERP responses to emotional faces was associated with observed maternal sensitivity. Findings add to the understanding of the neurobiology of deficits in parenting and suggest that these deficits are changeable through a parenting intervention.  MP: Maltreating mothers often struggle to respond sensitively to their children's distress. Examining psychophysiological processing of own child cues may offer insight into neurobiological mechanisms that promote sensitive parenting among high-risk mothers. The current study used event-related potential (ERP) methodology to examine associations between mothers' neural responses to their own child versus other children and observed sensitivity to distress. Participants included 73 mothers: 42 with histories of child protective services (CPS) involvement and 31 low-risk comparison mothers. Maternal sensitivity to child distress was coded from observations of children's blood sample collection. Late positive potential (LPP) ERP responses, which reflect sustained attention to emotionally salient stimuli, were measured when mothers viewed photos of their own child and other children. An own-other LPP difference score (own-other LPP) was computed by regressing the mean amplitude of mothers' LPP to their own child on the mean amplitude of mothers' LPP to other children. CPS-referred mothers and low-risk mothers did not differ in their LPP responses to own child, other children, or the own-other LPP. However, there was a significant interaction between group (CPS-referred vs. low-risk) and own-other LPP in predicting maternal sensitivity. Among the CPS-referred mothers, own-other LPP was significantly correlated with maternal sensitivity, with greater LPP amplitude to own versus other child associated with higher maternal sensitivity. In contrast, among the low-risk group, own-other LPP was not significantly correlated with maternal sensitivity. Findings add to our understanding of the neurobiology of sensitive parenting among high-risk mothers.  MP: This study examined the biological processes associated with foster mother-infant bonding. In an examination of foster mother-infant dyads (N = 41, mean infant age = 8.5 months), foster mothers' oxytocin production was associated with their expressions of behavioral delight toward their foster infant and their average P3 response to images of all infant faces in the first 2 months of the relationship. Three months later, foster mothers' oxytocin production was still associated with delight toward their foster infant and was also specifically associated with their P3 response to an image of their foster infant. Similar to biologically related mothers and infants, oxytocin appears to be associated with foster mothers' brain activity and caregiving behavior, with patterns suggestive of bond formation.   MP: Experiences with one's own infant attune the parent nervous system to infant stimuli. To explore the effects of motherhood on brain activity patterns, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while primipara mothers of 3-and 6-month-olds viewed images of faces of their own child and an unfamiliar but appearance-matched child. Mothers of 3-and 6-month-olds showed equivalent early-wave (N/P1 visual and N170 face-sensitive) responses to own and unfamiliar baby faces but differentiating late-wave (N/P600 familiar/novel) activity to own versus unfamiliar infant faces. Based on 3 months experience with their own infant's face, mothers' brain patterns give evidence of distinctive late-wave (recognition) sensitivity.  MP: Crying by an infant signals an urgent desire for care and protection. Because of the special relationship between a mother and her infant and the signal value of her crying, it is plausible to suggest that the maternal brain efficiently processes crying by infants. In the present study, we examined this hypothesis by measuring event-related potentials in mothers while they observed crying or smiling by their own or unfamiliar infants embedded within a train of neutral expressions. We found that the amplitude of the face-specific N170 component was enlarged for crying regardless of familiarity. The P300 component, which reflects a later cognitive evaluation stage of stimulus processing, was decomposed into functionally distinct components by temporal principal component analysis. The amplitude of the third temporal factor, which corresponds to the earliest portion of the P300, was larger when a mother observed her own infant crying than for the other conditions. Moreover, onset latency of P300 was shortest when mothers observed their own infant crying. These results indicate that mothers process their own infant's crying more efficiently than smiling by their own infant or crying by an unfamiliar infant.   MP: An attachment bond between a mother and her child is one of the most intimate human relationships. It is important for a mother to be sensitive to her child's gaze direction because exchanging gaze information plays a vital role in their relationship. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed differential neural activation patterns in mothers when presented the faces of their own children or the unfamiliar child of other people. Based on these findings, in the present study, we investigated whether mothers show differential neural responses to gaze information of their own child compared to that of an unfamiliar child. To this end, event-related-potentials elicited by the faces of one's own or an unfamiliar child with straight or averted gaze directions were measured using an oddball-paradigm. The results showed that peak amplitudes of the N170 component were enlarged by viewing the straight gazes compared to the averted gazes of one's own child, but not of an unfamiliar child. When the gaze was directed straight, the P3 amplitude elicited by one's own child's face is smaller than that elicited by an unfamiliar child's face. P3s elicited in viewing one's own child's face with averted gaze and in viewing an unfamiliar child's face with straight gaze were positively correlated with state-anxiety. These results bolster the hypothesis that processing the gaze information of one's own child elicits differential neural activation compared to the gaze information of an other person's unfamiliar child at both perceptual and evaluative stages of face processing.  MP: The transition to motherhood triggers changes in human brain structure that may facilitate mother–infant bonding. Although much research on maternal cortical responses to infant faces has focused on the postpartum period, no previous study has examined whether longitudinal functional changes in the maternal cortex during pregnancy and postpartum are associated with mother–infant bonding. Using electroencephalography, prenatal to postnatal changes in cortical sensitivity (P1, P2, late positive potential, N170 event-related potentials) to infant and adult faces were examined in relation to reported mother–infant bonding in 40 mothers (Mage = 30.5 years). Prenatal to postnatal increases in P1 and P2 responses to infant faces predicted stronger bonding. Findings suggest that cortical changes in attention allocation rather than in face-specific encoding enhance bonding.  MP: Certain infant facial characteristics, referred to as baby schema, are thought to automatically trigger parenting behavior and affective orientation toward infants. Electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited to assessing the intuitive nature and temporal dynamics of parenting responses, due to its millisecond temporal resolution. Little is known, however, about the relations between neural processing of infant cues and actual parenting behavior in a naturalistic setting. In the present study we examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) of mothers (N = 33) watching infant faces of varying attractiveness, in relation to activation of the maternal care system and the mothers’ observed parenting behavior (sensitivity, nonintrusiveness) with their own child (2–6 years old). The results revealed that, irrespective of the cuteness of the infant face, mothers’ neural processing of infant faces involved both early P1 and P2 components (related to orienting/detecting processes) and late positive potentials (LPPs; related to more controlled cognitive evaluation/attentional engagement). Increased early detection and processing of infant faces (reflected by P1 and P2 activity) was related to increased activation of the parental care system. In later stages of face processing, increased attentional engagement with infant faces (as reflected by LPP activity) was associated with more intrusiveness of a mother with her own child during interaction. These findings suggest that individual variations in responses to infant stimuli are associated with individual differences in parental care system activation and parenting quality. Furthermore, the parental care system might be activated relatively automatically, but actual parenting and caregiving behavior requires more conscious control.  MP: To examine emotional face processing in mothers of different attachment representations, event-related potentials were recorded from 16 mothers during presentation of infant emotion faces with positive, negative or neutral emotional expressions within a three-stimulus oddball paradigm, and frontal asymmetries were assessed. Insecure mothers, as compared to secure ones, showed a more pronounced negativity in the face-sensitive N170 component and a smaller N200 amplitude. Regarding the P300 component, secure mothers showed a stronger response to face stimuli than insecure mothers. No differences were found for frontal asymmetry scores. The results indicate that attachment differences may be related to neuropsychological functioning.  MP: This study employed visually evoked event-related potential (ERP) methodology to examine temporal patterns of structural and higher-level face processing in birth and foster/adoptive mothers viewing pictures of their children. Fourteen birth mothers and 14 foster/adoptive mothers engaged in a computerized task in which they viewed facial pictures of their own children, and of familiar and unfamiliar children and adults. All mothers, regardless of type, showed ERP patterns suggestive of increased attention allocation to their own children's faces compared to other child and adult faces beginning as early as 100-150 ms after stimulus onset and lasting for several hundred milliseconds. These data are in line with a parallel processing model that posits the involvement of several brain regions in simultaneously encoding the structural features of faces as well as their emotional and personal significance. Additionally, late positive ERP patterns associated with greater allocation of attention predicted mothers' perceptions of the parent-child relationship as positive and influential to their children's psychological development. These findings suggest the potential utility of using ERP components to index maternal processes.  MP: This research examined mothers’ secure base script knowledge—reflected in the ability to generate narratives in which attachment-relevant problems are recognized, competent help is offered, and problems are resolved—and its significance for early-stage processing of infants’ distress cues, using event-related potentials in an emotion oddball task. Mothers with lower secure base script knowledge exhibited (a) a heightened P3b response—reflective of greater allocation of cognitive resources—to their infants’ distressed (but not happy) target facial expressions; (b) a larger P3b response to their infants’ distressed (compared with happy) target facial expressions, which is indicative of allocating disproportional attentional resources to processing their infants’ distress; and (c) poorer accuracy in identifying their infants’ distressed target facial expressions. Findings suggest that mothers’ attachment-relevant biases in processing their infants’ emotion cues are especially tied to infant distress and shed light on underlying mechanisms linking mothers’ attachment representations with sensitive responding to infant distress.  MP: Parent–infant interaction is known to be influenced bidirectionally by parent and infant characteristics. However, it is unclear whether infant temperament affects parents’ neural responses to infant stimuli. 85 infants (6–12 months) were filmed in distress-eliciting tasks, which were coded for infants’ negative affect. Mothers’ reported infant affect was obtained from the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Very Short Form-Revised. Mothers’ EEG activity was recorded while passively viewing photos of own, familiarized, and unfamiliar infants. Multiple regression indicated that mothers who reported greater infant negative affect showed a smaller difference in the late positive potential (LPP) response to own infant versus familiarized infant, controlling for researcher-coded infant negative affect. The findings suggest that parents’ perceptions of their infant's temperament, but not independent measures of infant temperament, are related to electrocortical indices of emotional attention.  MP: In the current study, we examined how latent profiles reflecting maternal neural response to infant emotional expressions predict observed parenting behavior. Participants included 86 mothers of infants. Maternal sensitivity was coded from video-recorded distress and play interactions; mothers’ event-related potentials (ERPs) to child emotional expressions were measured from EEG activity recorded during a categorization task. Latent profile analysis of mothers’ P200 and late positive potential (LPP) responses to crying and laughing child expressions identified three latent profiles, characterized by enhanced or attenuated responses to crying and laughing expressions at early and late stages of processing. Mothers’ probability of being assigned to the “attenuated to distress” profile, characterized by undifferentiated early and late response to infant emotional expressions, was associated with reduced maternal sensitivity. Probability of being assigned to this profile was also correlated with sociodemographic risk. Profiles of maternal neural response to infant emotional expressions may enhance our understanding of the phenomenology of insensitive caregiving.  MP: The perception of infant emotions is an integral part of sensitive caregiving within the mother-child relationship, a maternal ability which develops in mothers during their own attachment history. In this study we address the association between maternal attachment representation and brain activity underlying the perception of infant emotions. Event related potentials (ERPs) of 32 primiparous mothers were assessed during a three stimulus oddball task presenting negative, positive and neutral emotion expressions of infants as target, deviant or standard stimuli. Attachment representation was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview during pregnancy. Securely attached mothers recognized emotions of infants more accurately than insecurely attached mothers. ERPs yielded amplified N170 amplitudes for insecure mothers when focusing on negative infant emotions. Secure mothers showed enlarged P3 amplitudes to target emotion expressions of infants compared to insecure mothers, especially within conditions with frequent negative infant emotions. In these conditions, P3 latencies were prolonged in insecure mothers. In summary, maternal attachment representation was found associated with brain activity during the perception of infant emotions. This further clarifies psychological mechanisms contributing to maternal sensitivity."
"Event-related potentials (ERPs) are an excellent tool for investigating parental neural responses to child stimuli. Using meta-analysis, we quantified the results of available studies reporting N170 or LPP/P3 ERP responses to children’s faces, targeting three questions: 1) Do parents and non-parents differ in ERP responses to child faces? 2) Are parental ERP responses larger to own vs. unfamiliar child faces? 3) Are parental ERP responses to child faces associated with indicators of parenting quality, such as observed parental sensitivity? Across 23 studies (N = 1035), key findings showed 1) larger N170 amplitudes to child faces in parents than in non-parents (r = 0.19), 2) larger LPP/P3 responses to own vs. unfamiliar child faces in parents (r = 0.19), and 3) positive associations between parental LPP/P3 responses to child faces and parenting quality outcomes (r = 0.15). These results encourage further research particularly with the LPP/P3 to assess attentional-motivational processes of parenting, but also highlight the need for larger samples and more systematic assessments of associations between ERPs and parenting.  ","MP: Parental reflective functioning refers to the capacity for a parent to understand their own and their infant’s mental states, and how these mental states relate to behavior. Higher levels of parental reflective functioning may be associated with greater sensitivity to infant emotional signals in fostering adaptive and responsive caregiving. We investigated this hypothesis by examining associations between parental reflective functioning and neural correlates of infant face and cry perception using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of recent mothers. We found both early and late ERPs were associated with different components of reflective functioning. These findings suggest that parental reflective functioning may be associated with the neural correlates of infant cue perception and further support the value of enhancing reflective functioning as a mechanism in parenting intervention programs.  MP: Oxytocin (OT) plays a crucial role in parental-infant bonding and attachment. Recent functional imaging studies reveal specific attachment and reward related brain regions in individuals or within the parent-child dyad. However, the time course and functional stage of modulatory effects of OT on attachment-related processing, especially in fathers, are poorly understood. To elucidate the functional and neural mechanisms underlying the role of OT in paternal-child attachment, we performed an event-related potential study in 24 healthy fathers who received intranasal OT in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject experimental design. Participants passively viewed pictures of their own child (oC), a familiar (fC) and an unfamiliar child (ufC) while event-related potentials were recorded.Familiarity of the child's face modulated a broad negativity at occipital and temporo-parietal electrodes within a time window of 300-400. ms, presumably reflecting a modulation of the N250 and N300 ERP components. The oC condition elicited a more negative potential compared to the other familiarity conditions suggesting different activation of perceptual memory representations and assignment of emotional valence. Most importantly, this familiarity effect was only observed under placebo (PL) and was abolished under OT, in particular at left temporo-parietal electrodes. This OT induced attenuation of ERP responses was related to habitual attachment representations in fathers.In summary, our results demonstrate an OT-specific effect at later stages of attachment-related face processing presumably reflecting both activation of perceptual memory representations and assignment of emotional value.  MP: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impaired adult facial processing, as shown by the N170 event-related potential. However, few studies explore such processing in mothers of children with ASD, and none has assessed the early processing of infant faces in these women. Moreover, whether processing of infant facial expressions in mothers of children with ASD is related to their response to their child's needs (maternal sensitivity [MS]) remains unknown. This study explored the N170 related to infant faces in a group of mothers of children with ASD (MA) and a reference group of mothers of children without ASD. For both emotional (crying, smiling) and neutral expressions, the MA group exhibited larger amplitudes of N170 in the right hemisphere, while the reference group showed similar interhemispheric amplitudes. This lateralization effect within the MA group was not present for nonfaces and was stronger in the mothers with higher MS. We propose that mothers of ASD children use specialized perceptual resources to process infant faces, and this specialization is mediated by MS. Our findings suggest that having an ASD child modulates mothers' early neurophysiological responsiveness to infant cues. Whether this modulation represents a biological marker or a response given by experience remains to be explored. Autism Research 2019, 12: 744–758. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary: When mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) see baby faces expressing emotions, they show a right-sided electrical response in the brain. This lateralization was stronger in mothers who were more sensitive to their children's needs. We conclude that having a child with ASD and being more attuned to their behavior generates a specialized pattern of brain activity when processing infant faces. Whether this pattern is biological or given by experience remains to be explored.  MP: Infant faces are highly salient social stimuli that appear to elicit intuitive parenting behaviors in healthy adult women. Behavioral and observational studies indicate that this effect may be modulated by experiences of reproduction, caregiving, and psychiatric symptomatology that affect normative attention and reward processing of infant cues. However, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of these effects. Using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, this study investigated the impact of parental status (mother, non-mother) and depression symptoms on early visual processing of infant faces in a community sample of adult women. Specifically, the P1 and N170 ERP components elicited in response to infant face stimuli were examined. While characteristics of the N170 were not modulated by parental status, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between depression symptom severity and N170 amplitude. This relationship was not observed for the P1. These results suggest that depression symptoms may modulate early neurophysiological responsiveness to infant cues, even at sub-clinical levels.  MP: Recent studies suggest that parental caregiving is associated with adaptive changes in neurocognitive responses to emotional cues and oxytocin function, possibly reflecting the increased need of parents to monitor infants' emotional states. In the current study, we investigated whether the changes associated with motherhood and oxytocin receptor genetic variation rs53576 are specific to the processing of infant cues as opposed to a more general increase in responsiveness to emotional cues. We measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral recognition responses from mothers of young infants (n = 48) and nulliparous females (n = 46) to infant and adult faces displaying strong and mild intensity emotional expressions. Mothers and GG allele carriers of the OXTR gene showed an early latency (~100 ms) differential frontal ERP response to strong intensity facial expressions, and mothers also showed modulation of the posterior EPN waveform by negative valence. The early frontal ERP modulation was associated with faster emotion recognition performance across participants. Most importantly, these effects were highly specific to infant facial expressions. The results point to a dissociable neurocognitive system that is involved in monitoring infants' emotional cues and may be important in supporting parental caregiving in humans.   MP: This study sought to determine the influence of gender and parental status on the brain potentials elicited by viewing infant facial expressions. We used ERP recording during a judgement task of infant happy/distressed expression to investigate if viewer gender or parental status affects the visual cortical response at various stages of perceptual processing. ERPs were recorded in 38 adults (male/female, parents/non-parents) during processing of infant facial expressions that varied in valence and intensity. All infants were unfamiliar to viewers. The lateral occipital P110 response was much larger in women than in men, regardless of facial expression, thus indicating a gender difference in early visual processing. The occipitotemporal N160 response provided the first evidence of discrimination of expressions of discomfort and distress and demonstrated a significant gender difference within the parent group, thus suggesting a strong interactive influence of genetic predisposition and parental status on the responsivity of visual brain areas. The N245 component exhibited complete coding of the intensity of facial expression, including positive expressions. At this processing stage the cerebral responses of female and male non-parents were significantly smaller than those of parents and insensitive to differences in the intensity of infant suffering. Smaller P300 amplitudes were elicited in mothers versus fathers, especially with infant expressions of suffering. No major group differences were observed in cerebral responses to happy or comfortable expressions. These findings suggest that mere familiarity with infant faces does not explain group differences.  MP: This investigation examined the neural and personality correlates of processing infant facial expressions in mothers with substantiated neglect of a child under 5 years old. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 14 neglectful and 14 control mothers as they viewed and categorized pictures of infant cries, laughs, and neutral faces. Maternal self-reports of anhedonia and empathy were also completed. Early (negative occipitotemporal component peaking at around 170 ms on the scalp [N170] and positive electrical potential peaking at about 200 ms [P200]) and late positive potential (LPP) components were selected. Both groups of mothers showed behavioral discrimination between the different facial expressions via reaction time and accuracy measures. Neglectful mothers did not exhibit increased N170 amplitude at temporal leads in response to viewing crying versus laughing and neutral expressions compared to control mothers. Both groups had greater P200 and LPP amplitudes at centroparietal leads in response to viewing crying versus neutral facial expressions. However, neglectful mothers displayed an overall attenuated brain response in LPP that was related to their higher scores in social anhedonia but not to their empathy scores. The ERP data suggest that the brain's failures in the early differentiation of cry stimuli and in the sustained processing of infant expressions related to social anhedonia may underlie the insensitive responding in neglectful mothers. The implications of these results for the design and evaluation of preventive interventions are discussed."
"Background Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been increasingly used as anticoagulation therapy in the postoperative period. However, their effectiveness in post-cardiac surgical atrial fibrillation is yet to be determined.  Methods We conducted a meta-analysis, searching three international databases from 1 January 2003 to 26 January 2022 for studies reporting on DOACs in at least 10 adult patients (>18 yr of age) with post-cardiac surgical atrial fibrillation. The primary outcomes were major neurological events and bleeding; secondary outcomes were mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, cost, and other complications from therapy. We included studies of any design, including RCTs, cohort studies with and without propensity score matching methods, and single-armed case series.  Results Twelve studies (8587 DOACs; 8315 warfarin) were included in this meta-analysis. The incidences of postoperative bleeding and major neurological events with DOACs were 7.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4–14.7%) and 2.2% (95% CI: 0.9–4.9%), respectively. The incidence of major neurological events was lower in high-risk patients, including those with hypertension and higher CHA2DS2-VASc score, whereas patients with prior transient ischaemic attack or stroke had higher incidence of bleeding. Trial sequential analysis revealed that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the conventional boundary of benefit. Compared with warfarin, DOACs reduced the risk of bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62–0.89; P=0.0011) and major neurological events (RR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.48–0.83; P=0.0012) but not mortality (RR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.77–1.35; P=0.090).  Conclusions DOACs reduced bleeding and major neurological events in patients with post-cardiac surgical atrial fibrillation, appearing safer than warfarin in this context. However, which specific DOAC provides the most effective anticoagulation in this patient population needs further investigation.","MP: Background The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are indicated for the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but their use in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is less well defined. Methods All patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 2013 to 2015 (n = 598) were studied. Patients with POAF anticoagulated with either warfarin or NOACs were evaluated for differences in length of stay, blood product use, bleeding, and cost of therapy. Results There was no significant difference between the NOAC and warfarin group for any of the clinical outcomes evaluated. Time to therapeutic anticoagulation was significantly longer with warfarin. Neither group had a major bleeding event during the initial hospitalization, but 2 patients in the warfarin group had delayed major bleeding complications. Total costs were significantly reduced in patients treated with NOACs. Conclusions Both NOACs and warfarin are safe and effective means of anticoagulation for POAF after coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients were therapeutic more rapidly and with less cost of treatment when NOACs were used.  MP: Objectives Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor shown to be an effective alternative to warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). We evaluated the use of dabigatran in patients with bioprosthetic mitral and/or aortic valve replacement and AF.  Methods We selected 34 and randomized 27 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive dabigatran or warfarin. The primary endpoint was the presence of a new intracardiac thrombus at 90 days, by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Secondary endpoints included the development of dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) and incidence of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), myocardium infarction, valve thrombosis and peripheral embolic events.  Results The trial was terminated prematurely because of low enrollment. There were 27 patients in total: 15 patients placed in the dabigatran group and 12 in the warfarin group. After 90 days, one patient (8.3 %) in the warfarin group and none in the dabigatran group had developed a new intracardiac thrombus. In the dabigatran group, two patients (13.3 %) developed dense SEC versus one patient (8.3 %) in the warfarin group. In the warfarin group, one patient (8.3 %) presented ischemic stroke, and none did in the dabigatran group. We observed no cases of hemorrhagic stroke, valve thrombosis, embolic events or myocardial infarction in either group throughout the study. However, one patient (6.7 %) in the dabigatran group had a fully recovered transient ischemic attack and one patient in the warfarin group died of heart failure.  Conclusions The use of dabigatran appears to be similar to warfarin in preventing the formation of intracardiac thrombus.  MP: BACKGROUND The effects of rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation and a bioprosthetic mitral valve remain uncertain.  METHODS In this randomized trial, we compared rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) with dose-adjusted warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in patients with atrial fibrillation and a bioprosthetic mitral valve. The primary outcome was a composite of death, major cardiovascular events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, valve thrombosis, or hospitalization for heart failure), or major bleeding at 12 months.  RESULTS A total of 1005 patients were enrolled at 49 sites in Brazil. A primary-outcome event occurred at a mean of 347.5 days in the rivaroxaban group and 340.1 days in the warfarin group (difference calculated as restricted mean survival time, 7.4 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.4 to 16.3; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Death from cardiovascular causes or thromboembolic events occurred in 17 patients (3.4%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 26 (5.1%) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.20). The incidence of stroke was 0.6% in the rivaroxaban group and 2.4% in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (1.4%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 13 (2.6%) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.35). The frequency of other serious adverse events was similar in the two groups.  CONCLUSIONS In patients with atrial fibrillation and a bioprosthetic mitral valve, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to the mean time until the primary outcome of death, major cardiovascular events, or major bleeding at 12 months.  MP: Background The optimal anticoagulation strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bioprosthetic valve (BPV) replacement or native valve repair remains uncertain.  Hypothesis We evaluated the safety and efficacy of apixaban vs warfarin in patients with AF and a history of BPV replacement or native valve repair.  Methods Using data from Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) (n = 18 201), a randomized trial comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with AF, we analyzed the subgroup of patients (n = 251) with prior valve surgery. We contacted sites by telephone to obtain additional data about prior valve surgery. Full data were available for 156 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was stroke/systemic embolism. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Treatment groups were compared using a Cox regression model.  Results In ARISTOTLE, 104 (0.6%) patients had a history of BPV replacement (n = 73 [aortic], n = 26 [mitral], n = 5 [mitral and aortic]) and 52 (0.3%) had a history of valve repair (n = 50 [mitral], n = 2 [aortic]). Among patients with BPVs, 55 were randomized to apixaban and 49 to warfarin. Among those with a history of native valve repair, 32 were randomized to apixaban and 20 to warfarin. Overall clinical event rates were low, with no significant differences between apixaban and warfarin for any outcomes.  Conclusions In patients with AF and a history of BPV replacement or repair, the safety and efficacy of apixaban compared with warfarin was consistent with results from ARISTOTLE. These data suggest that apixaban may be reasonable for patients with BPVs or prior valve repair, though future larger randomized trials are needed.  MP: Background: The efficacy of novel nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent stroke is well assessed, but NOACs use in AF that occurs after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) is not endorsed. This retrospective real-world study evaluated the efficacy and safety of NOACs prescribed no earlier than 4 months after AVR as an alternative to warfarin in patients with AF. Methods: We pooled 1032 patients from the databases of 5 centers. Ischemic/embolic events and major bleeding rates were compared between 340 patients assuming NOACs and 692 prescribed warfarin. Propensity score matching was performed to avoid the bias between groups. Results: The NOACs vs warfarin embolic/ischemic rate was 13.5% (46 of 340) vs 22.7% (157 of 692), respectively, (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.75; P < .001), and the incidence rate was 3.7% vs 6.9% patients/year, respectively (log-rank test P = .009). The major bleeding rate was 7.3% (25 of 340) vs 13% (90 of 692) (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.33-0.84; P = .007), and the incidence rate was 2% vs 4% patients/year (log-rank test P = .002.) After propensity score matching, the NOACs vs warfarin embolic/ischemic rate was 13.1% (42 of 321) vs 21.8% (70 of 321) (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9; P = .02), and the incidence rate was 4.1% vs 6.7% patients/year (log rank test P = .01). The major bleeding rate was 7.8% (25 of /321) vs 13.7% (44 of 321) (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.31-0.86; P = .01), and the incidence rate was 2.4% vs 4.2% patients/year (log-rank P = .01). Conclusions: In a real-word study, NOACs use overcomes the indications provided by guidelines. This study evidenced that NOACs use in patients who developed AF after bioprosthetic AVR was more effective in prevention of thromboembolism and safe in reduction of major bleeding events compared with warfarin.  MP: Background: Treatment guidelines for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend use of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over warfarin, yet clinical trials excluded individuals with post cardiac surgery AF. We sought to compare outcomes with NOACs vs warfarin for new onset post cardiac surgery AF. Methods: We examined 26,522 patients from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ database with post cardiac surgery AF who were discharged on oral anticoagulation from July 2017–December 2018. Three primary outcomes were evaluated: 30-day mortality, major bleeding complications, and stroke/transient ischemic attack. Secondary outcomes included postoperative length of stay, 30-day myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, and pericardial effusion/tamponade. Results: A total of 9769 (36.8%) participants were prescribed NOACs and 16,753 (63.2%) warfarin. In multivariable analysis, there was no association between type of anticoagulant and 30-day major bleeding complications (odds ratio [OR]NOAC/warfarin 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-1.18), stroke/transient ischemic attack (ORNOAC/warfarin 0.94, 95% CI 0.53-1.67) or mortality (ORNOAC/warfarin 1.08, 95% CI 0.80-1.45). After stratification by renal function or isolated coronary bypass vs valve surgery, there remained no difference in the primary outcomes. Additionally, there was no difference in 30-day myocardial infarction (ORNOAC/warfarin 1.17, 95% CI 0.62-2.22), venous thromboembolism (ORNOAC/warfarin 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.78), or pericardial effusion/tamponade (ORNOAC/warfarin 1.09, 95% CI 0.80-1.47) between the 2 groups. NOAC therapy was associated with a half-day reduction in postoperative length of stay (βNOAC/warfarin –0.47, 95% CI –0.62 to –0.33). Conclusions: NOACs are associated with a reduction in postoperative length of stay, without excess bleeding or other short-term complications, compared with warfarin. These findings support the broader use of NOACs as a safe alternative to warfarin in patients with post cardiac surgery AF at elevated stroke risk and acceptable bleeding risk.  MP: Purpose: The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bioprosthetic heart valve is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the tolerability and effectiveness of treatment with DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF and a bioprosthetic heart valve in clinical practice. Methods: Data for this study were sourced from the multicenter, prospectively maintained AF Research Database (NCT03760874), which includes all patients with AF undergoing follow-up at participating centers through outpatient visits every 3–6 months. The rates of occurrence of thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism), major bleed, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were assessed. These data were used for quantifying the net clinical benefit (NCB) of DOACs versus VKAs, in accordance with the following formula: (Thromboembolic events incidence rate with VKAs – Thromboembolic events incidence rate with DOACs) – Weighting factor × (ICH rate with DOACs – ICH incidence rate with VKAs). The database was retrospectively queried for patients with AF who were prescribed a DOAC or VKA and had a history of bioprosthetic heart valve replacement. Findings: A total of 434 patients with AF (DOACs, n = 211; VKAs, n = 223) were identified. Propensity score matching identified 130 patients prescribed DOACs (apixaban, 55.4%; rivaroxaban, 30.0%; dabigatran, 13.1%; edoxaban, 1.4%) and the same number of VKA recipients (warfarin, 89.2%; acenocoumarol, 10.8%). The mean (SD) duration of follow-up was 26.8 (2.3) months. The incidence rates of thromboembolic events were 1.3 per 100 person-years in the DOAC group versus 2.0 per 100 person-years in the VKA group (P = 0.14). The incidence rates of major bleed events were 2.6 per 100 person-years in the DOAC group versus 4.9 per 100 person-years in the VKA group (P = 0.47). The incidence rates of ICH were 0.38 per 100 person-years in the DOAC group versus 1.16 in the VKA group (hazard ratio = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.05–2.34; P = 0.3). A positive NCB of DOACs over VKAs of +1.87 was found. Implications: According to these data from clinical practice, DOACs seem to be associated with a greater NCB versus VKAs in patients with AF with a bioprosthetic heart valve, primarily due to lower rates of both major bleeds and thromboembolic events.  MP: Direct oral anticoagulants have recently been recommended for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, but have rarely been studied in the field of cardiac surgery. We prospectively investigated the safety of edoxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant, for use in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), which is the most common complication of cardiac surgery and can lead to stroke.  The subjects were adult cardiac surgery patients with POAF who received oral edoxaban for 2 months in an open-label pilot study. The primary endpoint was cerebrovascular/bleeding events up to 2 months, while the secondary endpoints were hemoglobin, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time.  There were no cerebrovascular or bleeding events during edoxaban treatment and the test drug was not discontinued by any patient. There was no macroscopic hematuria and hemoglobin did not decrease, being significantly higher than the baseline level after 2 months. The prothrombin time was significantly prolonged from 1 week to 2 months and the activated partial thromboplastin time was significantly prolonged from 1 day to 2 months. Echocardiography detected pericardial effusion in 1 patient, but hemoglobin did not decrease and the effusion improved with diuretic therapy.  In conclusion, despite the limited sample size of this pilot study, it was demonstrated that edoxaban does not induce bleeding in patients with POAF after cardiac surgery, suggesting that it is safe to perform a large-scale efficacy study of edoxaban as anticoagulant therapy for POAF.  MP: Purpose: Recently, guidelines recommended the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common post-surgical complication of cardiac surgery, but the efficacy and safety of DOAC for POAF have rarely been investigated. We conducted a prospective observational study to investigate the efficacy and safety of DOAC administered immediately after POAF.  Materials and Methods: In all, 135 patients that experienced POAF after cardiac surgery were treated with a DOAC. Primary endpoints were either bleeding or thromboembolic events. Secondary endpoints included changes in hemoglobin (Hb), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), serum creatinine (sCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and pleural/pericardial effusion.  Results: Patients were treated with apixaban (n = 31), edoxaban (n = 87), and rivaroxaban (n = 17). Major bleeding (p = 0.011) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (p = 0.047) were significantly more frequent in the rivaroxaban group. Stroke was observed in one rivaroxaban group patient and none in the other two groups.  Conclusion: DOAC as anticoagulation therapy for the early intervention of POAF following cardiac surgery is associated with a low incidence of major bleeding; a favorable safety profile and excellent efficacy were demonstrated for DOAC. Furthermore, our results indicate that the safety and efficacy of apixaban and edoxaban are better than rivaroxaban.  MP: Purpose Prosthetic valve replacement is performed in several hundred thousand patients worldwide annually, and many of these patients have or will ultimately develop atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF). Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are not recommended in patients with AF and mechanical valves but have not been evaluated in patients with bioprosthetic valves. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs in patients with AF and bioprosthetic valves.  Methods A retrospective single-center cohort study was performed on all patients with bioprosthetic valve implantation, for whom a NOAC was prescribed for the indication of AF. Patients were evaluated for thromboembolic events including imaging confirmed ischemic stroke, clinically suspected transient ischemic attack, and major bleeding events (according to International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition).  Results In total, 73 patients (26 female, 35.6 %) were identified. NOAC therapy began, on average, 990.0 ± 1029.1 days after bioprosthetic valve implantation for an average duration of 511.8 ± 400.8 days. Aspirin was used concomitantly in a majority of patients (72.6 %). There were no ischemic strokes identified (0.0 %) and one possible TIA (1.4 %). There were 6 (8.2 %) minor and 5 (6.9 %) major bleeding events.  Conclusion The use of NOAC therapy for AF in patients with bioprosthetic valves appears safe and effective in the occurrence of thromboembolic events, however, at the expense of increased bleeding. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these findings."
"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic continues, and the death toll continues to surge. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on mortality in patients with COVID-19.  Methods A systematic search was made of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov, without language restrictions. Controlled clinical trials on treatment of COVID-19 with TPE, compared with standard of care, were reviewed. Studies were pooled according to risk ratios (RRs) and weighted mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results A total of six trials (enrolling 343 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Therapeutic plasma exchange showed significant effect on mortality (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69; P = 0.0008).  Conclusion TPE significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19. Plasma exchange therapy should be considered for patients with COVID-19.","MP: Assessment of efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) following life-threatening COVID-19. This was an open-label, randomised clinical trial of ICU patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (positive RT-qPCR plus ARDS, sepsis, organ failure, hyperinflammation). Study was terminated after 87/120 patients enrolled. Standard treatment plus TPE (n = 43) versus standard treatment (n = 44), and stratified by PaO2/FiO2 ratio (>150 vs. ≤150), were compared. Primary outcomes were 35-day mortality and TPE safety. Secondary outcomes were association between TPE and mortality, improvement in SOFA score, change in inflammatory biomarkers, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU length of stay (LOS). Eighty-seven patients [median age 49 (IQR 34–63) years; 82.8% male] were randomised (44 standard care; 43 standard care plus TPE). Days on MV (P = 0.007) and ICU LOS (P = 0.02) were lower in the TPE group. 35-Day mortality was non-significantly lower in the TPE group (20.9% vs. 34.1%; Kaplan-Meier, P = 0.582). TPE was associated with increased lymphocytes and ADAMTS-13 activity and decreased serum lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimers and interleukin-6. Multivariable regression analysis provided several predictors of 35-day mortality: PaO2/FiO2 ratio (HR, 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–1.00; P = 0.02]; ADAMTS-13 activity (HR, 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.98; P = 0.01); pulmonary embolism (HR, 3.57, 95% CI 1.43–8.92; P = 0.007). Post-hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction in SOFA score for TPE patients (P < 0.05). In critically-ill COVID-19 patients, addition of TPE to standard ICU therapy was associated with faster clinical recovery and no increased 35-day mortality.  MP: Background Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology and progression of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) by removing the pathogenic cytokines is hypothesized to dampen CRS. Objective To evaluate the outcomes of the patients with COVID-19 having CRS being treated with TPE compared to controls on the standard of care. Methodology Retrospective propensity score-matched analysis in a single centre from 1st April to 31st July 2020. We retrospectively analyzed data of 280 hospitalized patients developing CRS initially. PSM was used to minimize bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. Using PSM 1:1, 90 patients were selected and assigned to 2 equal groups. Forced matching was done for disease severity, routine standard care and advanced supportive care. Many other Co-variates were matched. Primary outcome was 28 days overall survival. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, CRS resolution time and timing of viral clearance on Polymerase chain reaction testing. Results After PS-matching, the selected cohort had a median age of 60 years (range 32–73 in TPE, 37–75 in controls), p = 0.325 and all were males. Median symptoms duration was 7 days (range 3–22 days’ TPE and 3–20 days controls), p = 0.266. Disease severity in both groups was 6 (6.6%) moderate, 40 (44.4%) severe and 44 (49%) critical. Overall, 28-day survival was significantly superior in the TPE group (91.1%), 95% CI 78.33–97.76; as compared to PS-matched controls (61.5%), 95% CI 51.29–78.76 (log rank 0.002), p<0.001. Median duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the TPE treated group (10 days vs 15 days) (p< 0.01). CRS resolution time was also significantly reduced in the TPE group (6 days vs. 12 days) (p< 0.001). In 71 patients who underwent TPE, the mortality was 0 (n = 43) if TPE was done within the first 12 days of illness while it was 17.9% (deaths 5, n = 28 who received it after 12th day (p = 0.0045). Conclusion An earlier use of TPE was associated with improved overall survival, early CRS resolution and time to discharge compared to SOC for COVID-19 triggered CRS in this selected cohort of PS-matched male patients from one major hospital in Pakistan.  MP: Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Methods: A case series of critically ill adult men and non-pregnant women, ≥18 years of age, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, was studied at the Royal Hospital, Oman, from April 17 to May 11, 2020. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was performed on patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe pneumonia. The analysis was performed using univariate statistics. Results: A total of 31 COVID-19 patients were included with an overall mean age of 51 ± 15 years (range: 27–76 years); 90% (n = 28) were males, and 35% (n = 11) of the patients had TPE as a mode of treatment. The TPE group was associated with higher extubation rates than the non-TPE cohort (73% versus 20%; p = 0.018). Additionally, patients on TPE had a lower 14 days (0 versus 35%; p = 0.033) and 28 days (0 versus 35%; p = 0.033) post plasma exchange mortality compared to patients not on TPE. However, all-cause mortality was only marginally lower in the TPE group compared to the non-TPE group (9.1% versus 45%; p = 0.055; power = 66%). Laboratory and ventilatory parameters also improved post TPE (n = 11). Conclusions: The use of TPE in severe COVID-19 patients has been associated with improved outcomes, however, randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to draw final, conclusive findings."
"Background Treatment response assessment in patients with brain metastasis uses contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. Advanced MRI techniques have been studied, but the diagnostic accuracy is not well known. Therefore, we performed a metaanalysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the currently available MRI techniques for treatment response.  Methods A systematic literature search was done. Study selection and data extraction were done by two authors independently. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. An independent cohort was used for DSC perfusion external validation of diagnostic accuracy.  Results Anatomical MRI (16 studies, 726 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 76%. DCE perfusion (4 studies, 114 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 92%. DSC perfusion (12 studies, 418 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity was 83% with a specificity of 78%. Diffusion weighted imaging (7 studies, 288 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 79%. MRS (4 studies, 54 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 78%. Combined techniques (6 studies, 375 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 88%. External validation of DSC showed a lower sensitivity and a higher specificity for the reported cut-off values included in this metaanalysis.  Conclusion A combination of techniques shows the highest diagnostic accuracy differentiating tumor progression from treatment induced abnormalities. External validation of imaging results is important to better define the reliability of imaging results with the different techniques.","MP: BACKGROUND Pseudoprogression (PsP) or radiation necrosis (RN) may frequently occur after cranial radiotherapy and show a similar imaging pattern compared to progressive disease (PD). Even for experienced neuroradiologists, it remains challenging to distinguish between these clinically relevant disease states. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based Contrast Clearance Analysis (CCA) in this clinical setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with equivocal imaging findings after cranial radiotherapy were consecutively included into this monocentric prospective study. Assuming a true accuracy of 90% and setting the significance level to 0.05, N=33 patients are required to show that accuracy is larger than 70% with a power of 80% using a one-sided binomial test. CCA was performed by subtraction of imaging features in late vs early T1-weighted sequences after contrast-agent application. Two experienced neuroradiologists evaluated CCA with respect to PsP/RN and PD being blinded for FET PET and histological findings; histopathological diagnosis was based on stereotactic biopsy or resection for space-occupying processes. The radiological assessment was compared with the histopathological results, and its accuracy was calculated statistically. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were included; sixteen (48.5%) were treated because of a primary brain tumors, and 17 (51.1%) with brain metastases. In one patient, CCA was technically infeasible. The accuracy of CCA in predicting the histological result was 0.84 (95% CI 0.67–0.95; one-sided p=0.05; N=32). An accuracy of 0.85 (95% CI 0.68–0.95; one-sided p=0.04) would have been obtained in case of a correct classification in the non-analyzable case. Sensitivity and specificity of CCA were 0.93 (95%-CI 0.66–1.00) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.52–0.94), respectively. The accuracy in metastases patients was 0.94 (95% CI 0.71 - 1.00) and non-significantly higher compared to primary brain tumor patients with accuracy of 0.73 (95% CI 0.45 - 0.92), p=0.16. CONCLUSION In this study, CCA was a highly accurate, easy and helpful method for distinguishing PsP or RN from PD after cranial radiotherapy, especially in brain metastases patients after radiosurgical treatment.  MP: Purpose/Objective(s) Radiation necrosis (RN) is common and potentially debilitating after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BM). The goal of this study is to validate a previously reported radiomics signature for distinguishing RN from true progression (TP) using an independent image set. Materials/Methods Patients with BM were treated with Gammaknife SRS at Wake Forest University between 2004 and 2012 (WF dataset). Those who developed radiographic evidence of progression in the treated lesion and subsequently had pathologic confirmation were included. The lesions were identified on T1 post-contrast (T1c) and T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR) MRI. 51 T1c and 51 T2 FLAIR radiomics features were extracted using a software developed in house. An IsoSVM machine learning classifier model trained using our institutional data (JH dataset) was tested using WF dataset. Results Fifty-three lesions from 43 patients were included in this study, of which all had T1c and 33 had T2 FLAIR images available. Seven lesions were pure RN pathologically, while the TP group included 37 pure tumor and 9 mixed tumor and necrosis. Twenty-two patients (51%) underwent whole brain radiotherapy with a median dose of 35Gy. Median SRS marginal dose was 18Gy (range 10-22Gy). There was no statistically significant difference among baseline characteristics between RN and TP. Of the 6 T1c radiomic features from the JH dataset, 4 demonstrated the same trend in the WF dataset (neighborhood grey tone difference matrix (NGTDM) texture strength, NGTDM coarseness, grey level run length matrix (GLRLM) grey level nonuniformity, and GLRLM run percentage). NGTDM texture strength (mean RN 161.13 vs TP 70.86, p = 0.06), and NGTDM coarseness (mean RN 0.03 vs TP 0.02, p = 0.07) approached significance. Of the 4 FLAIR features, 3 showed similar trend (kurtosis, minimum, NGTDM texture strength). The original IsoSVM model trained with all 6 T1c and 4 FLAIR features showed sensitivity of 65%, specificity of 87%, and AUC of 0.81. Due to the limited number of cases with FLAIR available, we re-trained the model with JH dataset using only the 4 T1c features showing the same trend between the two datasets, resulting in sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 73%, with AUC of 0.8. This model when tested on the WF dataset showed sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 52%, with AUC of 0.62. When the model was re-trained with the 4 T1c and 3 FLAIR features trending similarly between the two datasets, the sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 100%, and the AUC improved to 0.84. Conclusion Radiomics profiling of post-SRS T1c and T2 FLAIR MRI showed promising trends between RN and TP in 4 T1c features across two independent datasets. Radiomics-based IsoSVM model can distinguish RN vs TP in individual patients. Statistical significance and model performance were inferior in the validation (WF) dataset due to smaller sample size and class imbalance with fewer RN cases. Further studies with larger datasets are needed to optimize and validate the model.  MP: Multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used for differentiation of radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence after gamma knife radiosurgery for intracranial metastases in 33 consecutive cases. All patients presented with enlargement of the treated lesion, increase of perilesional brain edema, and aggravation or appearance of neurological signs and symptoms on average 9.3 ± 4.9 months after primary treatment. Metabolic imaging defined four types of lesions: pure tumor recurrence (11 cases), partial tumor recurrence (11 cases), radiation-induced tumor necrosis (10 cases), and radiation-induced necrosis of the peritumoral brain (1 case). In 1 patient, radiation-induced tumor necrosis was diagnosed 9 months after radiosurgery; however, partial tumor recurrence was identified 6 months later. With the exception of midline shift, which was found to be more typical for radiation-induced necrosis (P < 0.01), no one clinical, radiologic, or radiosurgical parameter either at the time of primary treatment or at the time of deterioration showed a statistically significant association with the type of the lesion. Proton MRS-based diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all surgically treated patients (7 cases) and corresponded well to the clinical course in others. In conclusion, multivoxel proton MRS is an effective diagnostic modality for identification of radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence that can be used for monitoring of metabolic changes in intracranial neoplasms after radiosurgical treatment. It can be also helpful for differentiation of radiation-induced necrosis of the tumor and that of the peritumoral brain, which may have important clinical and medicolegal implications.  MP: Purpose/Objective(s) This project validates the ability of a novel clinical imaging-driven biophysical model to predict the etiology of enhancing lesions following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastasis (BM). These lesions present enormous clinical challenges as clinical symptoms and radiographic findings for radiation necrosis (RN) and tumor progression are often indistinguishable. We hypothesized that our model for differentiating RN from tumor progression could be validated in a large-scale retrospective cohort study. Materials/Methods A prospectively maintained database at our institution with 73 patients with 78 BM treated with SRS and histologically confirmed RN or tumor progression were retrospectively assessed using our biophysical model. Briefly, a reaction-diffusion logistic growth model mechanically coupled to the surrounding tissue was used to extract tumor cell proliferation rate and diffusion coefficients based on fitting areas of post-contrast T1-weighted MR enhancement observed during serial imaging time points. The model was then used to calculate mass effect due to the mechanical stress field incurred during lesion expansion. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to quantify the similarity of the model-estimated stress field with the edema front visualized in FLAIR imaging. These metrics for prediction of tumor progression versus RN were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve and compared to standard radiographic morphometric analysis including the change in the longest dimension of the lesion, change in the volume of the lesion, and FLAIR/T1 lesion quotient. Results Standard radiographic morphometric analysis of the serial post-contrast T1-weighted enhanced and FLAIR images reflected poor ability to differentiate between tumor progression and RN for the change in the longest dimension of the lesion (ROC AUC = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61 – 0.85, p = 0.0009, 74% sensitivity and 63% specificity), change in lesion volume (ROC AUC 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47 – 0.75, p = 0.1262, 43% sensitivity and 64% specificity), and FLAIR/T1 lesion quotient (ROC AUC = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.41 – 0.69, p = 0.4723, 77% sensitivity and 43% specificity). Conversely, parameters derived from our imaging-driven model were able to differentiate lesion etiology with excellent accuracy for tumor cell proliferation rate (ROC AUC = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76 – 0.95, p < 0.0001, 74% sensitivity and 95% specificity) and Dice similarity coefficient associated with high model-estimated mechanical stresses (ROC AUC = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86 – 0.99, p < 0.0001, 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity). Conclusion In patients with BM treated with SRS, our model demonstrated excellent accuracy for differentiating enhancing lesions and significantly outperforms standard radiographic assessment of image morphometric features.  MP: Purpose/Objective(s) Conventional MRI is unable to differentiate progression from treatment effects (TEs) in brain tumor patients. We have applied a novel technique, in which high-resolution treatment response assessment maps (TRAMs) are calculated from MRIs acquired with a delay of >1 hr, enabling separation between tumor (contrast clearance >1 hr post injection, blue in the TRAMs) and TEs (contrast accumulation, red) with no overlap. We studied potential applications for patient management in conventional/combined treatments. Materials/Methods Five hundred thirty-seven TRAMs were calculated for 192 patients with primary/metastatic brain tumors post conventional therapies (mostly chemoRT, SRS). In addition, 24 patients with recurrent HGGs were scanned by the TRAMs prior to, and periodically after, initiation of Bevacizumab (BEV) with/without re-RT. Results The TRAMs were validated histologically in 54 resected patients, resulting in 100% sensitivity and 92% PPV to active tumor. Following validation, the TRAMs were used for making 78 decisions to continue follow-up and 195 to change treatment (to surgery, chemoRT, RT, BEV, etc.). The incidence of decisions to change treatment was significantly higher in primary tumors (83%) than in metastases (54%). The TRAMs were also applied for depicting residual tumor post-surgery, detecting tumors within hemorrhages, and differentiating malignant transformation from TEs. Six of the 24 BEV-treated patients were responders (PFS≥6 months) and 18 non-responders (PFS<6 months); 90% of the patients demonstrated significant reduction in TEs 1 month (58±16% of original volume, P < .03) and up to 3 months (55±19%, P<0.04) posttreatment, suggesting BEV is effective in treating TEs. All responders depicted significant blue/tumor volumes prior to treatment (average 15.6 ± 8.9 mL), suggesting BEV induces antineoplastic effects as well. There was no correlation between initial tumor volumes and response. Seven patients underwent re-RT during BEV at progression. All showed significant radiological response in the TRAMs (blue/tumor decreased to 62±10% of original volume while red/TEs increased to 296±72%), in agreement with clinical stabilization, while conventional MRI showed radiological deterioration (T1-Gd/FLAIR showed stable/increased enhancing volumes reaching 92±21%/155±18% of original volumes). Overall survival of these patients, counted from progression under BEV was 170±16, while OS of patients on BEV without RT was 108±21 days, P < .02. Conclusion Our high-resolution, model-independent TRAMs may improve patient management by differentiating tumor/non-tumor tissues in brain tumors undergoing conventional treatments. Initial experience with BEV suggests the TRAMs may provide additional sensitivity to response to combined BEV-RT.  MP: Background: Conventional MRI is unable to differentiate tumor progression from treatment-induced effects (pseudoprogression/radiation-necrosis) in brain tumor patients, thus significantly impacting patients’ management with no current solution. Methods: We have applied a novel MRI-based methodology for high resolution depiction of tumor/non-tumor tissues. This unique model-independent technique is based on robust MRI sequences acquired with a delay, enabling complete separation between tumor (contrast clearance at the delayed time point) and treatment effects (contrast accumulation) with no overlap. 498 treatment response assessment maps were calculated for 149 patients with primary/metastatic brain tumors and 9 with AVM recruited/followed on study. Results: The maps were validated by comparing pre-surgical maps of 51 patients with primary/metastatic brain tumors who underwent surgery with histology, resulting in 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity to active tumor. This validation confirms that contrast clearance in the maps represent morphologically active tumor while contrast accumulation represents non-tumor tissues. Following initial validation, the maps were used for making 231 clinical decisions. In 67 cases the decision was to continue follow-up (no treatment change) and in 164 cases to change treatment (including surgery, chemoradiation, radiation treatments, switch to Avastin, etc). Our data demonstrates the application for management of patients with various types of tumors after various treatments, for depiction of residual tumor post surgery, detection of tumor within hemorrhages and differentiating malignant transformation from treatment effects. Conclusions: Our high resolution, easy to interpret, model-independent maps provide complete/clear differentiation between tumor/non-tumor tissues in patients with brain tumors. The increasing rate in which the maps are being used for clinical decisions making in Israel reflects their added value as an efficient/friendly tool for decision making in neuro-oncology. Excellent agreement between pre-surgical maps and histology suggests that the maps may be further applied for planning high precision procedures such as biopsies, resections, SRS and iMRT.  MP: Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a common treatment used in patients with brain metastases and is associated with high rates of local control, however, at the risk of radiation necrosis. It is difficult to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor progression using conventional MRI, making it a major diagnostic dilemma for practitioners. This prospective study investigated whether chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) was able to differentiate these two conditions. Experimental Design: Sixteen patients with brain metastases who had been previously treated with SRS were included. Average time between SRS and evaluation was 12.6 months. Lesion type was determined by pathology in 9 patients and the other 7 were clinically followed. CEST imaging was performed on a 3T Philips scanner and the following CEST metrics were measured: amide proton transfer (APT), magnetization transfer (MT), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and area under the curve for CEST peaks corresponding to amide and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE). Results: Five lesions were classified as progressing tumor and 11 were classified as radiation necrosis (using histopathologic confirmation and radiographic follow-up). The best separation was obtained by NOEMTR (NOEMTR,necrosis = 8.9 ± 0.9%, NOEMTR,progression = 12.6 ± 1.6%, P < 0.0001) and AmideMTR (AmideMTR,necrosis = 8.2 ± 1.0%, AmideMTR,progression = 12.0 ± 1.9%, P < 0.0001). MT (MTnecrosis = 4.7 ± 1.0%, MTprogression = 6.7 ± 1.7%, P = 0.009) and NOEAUC (NOEAUC,necrosis = 4.3 ± 2.0% Hz, NOEAUC,progression = 7.2 ± 1.9% Hz, P = 0.019) provided statistically significant separation but with higher P values. Conclusions: CEST was capable of differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression in brain metastases. Both NOEMTR and AmideMTR provided statistically significant separation of the two cohorts. However, APT was unable to differentiate the two groups.   MP: Background The differential diagnosis between radiation necrosis, tumor recurrence and tumor progression is crucial for the evaluation of treatment response and treatment planning. The appearance of treatment-induced tissue necrosis on conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is similar to brain tumor recurrence and it could be difficult to differentiate the two entities on follow-up MRI examinations. Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-enhanced (DSC) and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) are MRI perfusion techniques that use an exogenous, intravascular, non-diffusible gadolinium-based contrast agent. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of DSC and DCE perfusion MRI in the differential diagnosis between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence, in the follow-up of primary and metastatic intra-axial brain tumors after Stereotactic RadioSurgery (SRS) performed with CyberKnife. Methods A total of 72 enhancing lesions (57 brain metastases and 15 primary brain tumors) were analyzed with DCE and DSC, by means of MRI acquisition performed by 1,5 Tesla MR scanner. The statistical relationship between the diagnosis of tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis, decided according to clinicoradiologically criteria, rCBV and Ktrans was evaluated by the point-biserial correlation coefficient respectively. Results The statistical analysis showed a correlation between the diagnosis of radiation necrosis or recurrent tumor with Ktrans (rpb = 0.54, p < 0.001) and with rCBV (rpb = 0.37, p = 0.002). The ROC analysis of rCBV values demonstrated a good classification ability in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumour recurrence as well as the Ktrans. The optimal cut-off value for rCBV was k = 1.23 with 0.88 of sensitivity and 0.75 of specificity while for Ktrans was k = 28.76 with 0.89 of sensitivity and 0.97 of specificity. Conclusions MRI perfusion techniques, particularly DCE, help in the differential diagnosis by tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis during the follow-up after radiosurgery.  MP: Differentiating treatment-induced necrosis (TIN) from recurrent/progressive tumor (RPT) in brain tumor patients using conventional morphologic imaging features is a very challenging task. Functional imaging techniques also offer moderate success due to the complexity of the tissue microenvironment and the inherent limitation of the various modalities and techniques. The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the utility of nonmodel-based semiquantitative indices derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR perfusion (DCET1MRP) in differentiating TIN from RPT. Twenty-nine patients with previously treated brain tumors who showed recurrent or progressive enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI underwent DCET1MRP. Another 8 patients with treatment-naive high-grade gliomas who also underwent DCET1MRP were included as the control group. Semiquantitative indices derived from DCET1MRP included maximum slope of enhancement in initial vascular phase (MSIVP), normalized MSIVP (nMSIVP), normalized slope of delayed equilibrium phase (nSDEP), and initial area under the time-intensity curve (IAUC) at 60 and 120 s (IAUC60 and IAUC120) obtained from the enhancement curve. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P < .01), with the RPT group showing higher MSIVP (15.78 vs 8.06), nMSIVP (0.046 vs 0.028), nIAUC60 (33.07 vs 6.44), and nIAUC120 (80.14 vs 65.55) compared with the TIN group. nSDEP was significantly lower in the RPT group (7.20 × 10−5 vs 15.35 × 10−5) compared with the TIN group. Analysis of the receiver-operating-characteristic curve showed nMSIVP to be the best single predictor of RPT, with very high (95%) sensitivity and high (78%) specificity. Thus, nonmodel-based semiquantitative indices derived from DCET1MRP that are relatively easy to derive and do not require a complex model-based approach may aid in differentiating RPT from TIN and can be used as robust noninvasive imaging biomarkers.  MP: Background: Traditional imaging modalities are not useful in the follow-up of irradiated metastatic brain tumors, because radiation can change imaging characteristics. We aimed to assess the ability of treatment response assessment maps (TRAMs) calculated from delayed-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differentiation between radiation effect and persistent tumoral tissue. Methods: TRAMs were calculated by subtracting three-dimensional T1 MRIs acquired 5 minutes after contrast injection from the images acquired 60–105 minutes later. Red areas were regarded as radiation effect and blue areas as persistent tumoral lesion. Thirty-seven patients with 130 metastatic brain tumors who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and who underwent TRAMs perfusion-weighted MRI were enrolled in this retrospective study. Results: The median age was 58 years and the most common primary diagnosis was lung cancer (n = 21). The median follow-up period of patients was 12 months. The overall local control rate was 100% at 1 year and 98.9% at 2 years. The median progression-free survival was 12 months. The mean overall survival was 27.3 months. The radiologic and clinical follow-up showed a clinicoradiologic diagnosis of a persistent tumoral lesion in 3 tumors (2.3%) and radiation effect in 127 tumors (97.7%). There was a fair agreement between clinicoradiologic diagnosis and TRAMs analysis (κ = 0.380). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of TRAMs in diagnosing radiation effect were 96.06% and 99.2%, respectively. TRAMs showed comparable results to perfusion-weighted MRI, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 27.4 versus 20.7, respectively. Conclusions: The presented results show the ability of TRAMs in differentiating radiation effect and persistent tumoral lesions.  MP: "
"The present systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and other databases through November 2020. A total of 20 randomized clinical trials and 1263 trials were included in the meta-analysis. For each trial, the average difference, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated to evaluate the efficacy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increased the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers (relative risk, 1.901; 95% CI = 1.484–2.435, p < 0.0001), shortened the healing time (MD = −19.360; 95% CI = −28.753~-9.966, p < 0.001), and reduced the incidence of major amputation (relative risk, 0.518, 95% CI = 0.323–0.830, P < 0.01). In summary, our meta-analysis confirmed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy offers great benefits in the treatment of DFU and the reduction of amputation. In addition, larger and well-designed randomized controlled trials need to be planned and conducted to verify this conclusion.","MP: Aims Adjunctive treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy has recently been shown to improve ulcer healing in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcer. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the health related quality of life in these patients.  Methods Prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded study setting using SF-36.  Results A total of 75 patients were included in the study; 38 were randomized to hyperbaric oxygen therapy and 37 to placebo (hyperbaric air). The overall mean physical and mental summary scores for the entire study population at baseline were 29.6 ± 8.8 and 47.5 ± 12.4, respectively. There was a significant difference between baseline and 1 year follow-up responses to the mental summary score and two of the eight (SF-36) (?) domains in the -hyperbaric oxygen group, whereas no significant improvement of health related quality of life was seen in the placebo group. Comparing quality of life in patients who healed their ulcer (healers) with those who did not (non-healers), post-treatment levels of the mental health summary score, social functioning and role limitations due to physical and emotional health were significantly improved in healers. No differences were seen in any SF-36 (?) domain in non-healers.  Conclusions Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves long-term health related quality of life in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers, possibly attributable to better ulcer healing.  MP: Objective: Ischaemic lower-extremity ulcers in the diabetic population are a source of major concern because of the associated high risk of limb-threatening complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of hyperbaric oxygen in the management of these ulcers. Method: Eighteen diabetic patients with ischaemic, non-healing lower-extremity ulcers were recruited in a double-blind study. Patients were randomly assigned either to receive 100% oxygen (treatment group) or air (control group), at 2.4 atmospheres of absolute pressure for 90 min daily (total of 30 treatments). Results: Healing with complete epithelialisation was achieved in five out of eight ulcers in the treatment group compared to one out of eight ulcers in the control group. The median decrease of the wound areas in the treatment group was 100% and in the control group was 52% (p = 0.027). Cost-effectiveness analysis has shown that despite the extra cost involved in using hyperbaric oxygen, there was a potential saving in the total cost of treatment for each patient during the study. Conclusion: Hyperbaric oxygen enhanced the healing of ischaemic, non-healing diabetic leg ulcers and may be used as a valuable adjunct to conventional therapy when reconstructive surgery is not possible.  MP: OBJECTIVE Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The controlled evidence for the efficacy of this treatment is limited. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy of HBOT in reducing the need for major amputation and improving wound healing in patients with diabetes and chronic DFUs.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with diabetes and foot lesions (Wagner grade 2–4) of at least 4 weeks' duration participated in this study. In addition to comprehensive wound care, participants were randomly assigned to receive 30 daily sessions of 90 min of HBOT (breathing oxygen at 244 kPa) or sham (breathing air at 125 kPa). Patients, physicians, and researchers were blinded to group assignment. At 12 weeks postrandomization, the primary outcome was freedom from meeting the criteria for amputation as assessed by a vascular surgeon. Secondary outcomes were measures of wound healing.  RESULTS One hundred fifty-seven patients were assessed for eligibility, with 107 randomly assigned and 103 available for end point adjudication. Criteria for major amputation were met in 13 of 54 patients in the sham group and 11 of 49 in the HBOT group (odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.37, 2.28], P = 0.846). Twelve (22%) patients in the sham group and 10 (20%) in the HBOT group were healed (0.90 [0.35, 2.31], P = 0.823). All other indices of wound healing were also not statistically significantly different between groups.  CONCLUSIONS HBOT does not offer an additional advantage to comprehensive wound care in reducing the indication for amputation or facilitating wound healing in patients with chronic DFUs.  MP: OBJECTIVE Chronic diabetic foot ulcers are a source of major concern for both patients and health care systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in the management of chronic diabetic foot ulcers.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Diabetics with Chronic Foot Ulcers (HODFU) study was a randomized, single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The outcomes for the group receiving HBOT were compared with those of the group receiving treatment with hyperbaric air. Treatments were given in a multi-place hyperbaric chamber for 85-min daily (session duration 95 min), five days a week for eight weeks (40 treatment sessions). The study was performed in an ambulatory setting.  RESULTS Ninety-four patients with Wagner grade 2, 3, or 4 ulcers, which had been present for >3 months, were studied. In the intention-to-treat analysis, complete healing of the index ulcer was achieved in 37 patients at 1-year of follow-up: 25/48 (52%) in the HBOT group and 12/42 (29%) in the placebo group (P = 0.03). In a sub-analysis of those patients completing >35 HBOT sessions, healing of the index ulcer occurred in 23/38 (61%) in the HBOT group and 10/37 (27%) in the placebo group (P = 0.009). The frequency of adverse events was low.  CONCLUSIONS The HODFU study showed that adjunctive treatment with HBOT facilitates healing of chronic foot ulcers in selected patients with diabetes.  MP: OBJECTIVE Conflicting evidence exists on the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in the treatment of chronic ischemic leg ulcers. The aim of this trial was to investigate whether additional HBOT would benefit patients with diabetes and ischemic leg ulcers.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with diabetes with an ischemic wound (n = 120) were randomized to standard care (SC) without or with HBOT (SC+HBOT). Primary outcomes were limb salvage and wound healing after 12 months, as well as time to wound healing. Other end points were amputation-free survival (AFS) and mortality.  RESULTS Both groups contained 60 patients. Limb salvage was achieved in 47 patients in the SC group vs. 53 patients in the SC+HBOT group (risk difference [RD] 10% [95% CI −4 to 23]). After 12 months, 28 index wounds were healed in the SC group vs. 30 in the SC+HBOT group (RD 3% [95% CI −14 to 21]). AFS was achieved in 41 patients in the SC group and 49 patients in the SC+HBOT group (RD 13% [95% CI −2 to 28]). In the SC+HBOT group, 21 patients (35%) were unable to complete the HBOT protocol as planned. Those who did had significantly fewer major amputations and higher AFS (RD for AFS 26% [95% CI 10–38]).  CONCLUSIONS Additional HBOT did not significantly improve complete wound healing or limb salvage in patients with diabetes and lower-limb ischemia.  MP: Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have produced conflicting results about the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in improving the healing rate for chronic diabetic foot wounds. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of systemic HBOT in healing of chronic nonischemic diabetic foot ulcer. Thirty adult patients having Wagner’s grade 2 or 3 chronic diabetic foot ulcers, in whom the response to 30 days of standard wound care was not favorable, were prospectively randomized to have either HBOT (20-40 sessions) plus conventional treatment (n = 15) or conventional treatment alone (n = 15). Ischemic wounds and patients with contraindications to systemic HBOT were excluded. The primary end point was complete healing of the target ulcer. Secondary endpoints included the following: rate of ulcer healing at the end of treatment period and at 4 and 8 weeks thereafter as well as rate of amputation. A significantly greater percentage of HBOT-treated wounds (33.3%, 5/15) achieved complete closure than conventional therapy–treated wounds (0%, 0/15; P = .014) at the end of treatment. This significant difference was maintained throughout the 8 weeks of follow-up. Complications frequency was nonsignificantly different between both groups. Our study showed that HBOT plus conventional therapy appears as safe as and probably more effective than conventional therapy alone for the healing of chronic nonischemic diabetic foot wounds. Larger studies are required to confirm its specific indications.  MP: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of standard wound care with adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to standard wound care alone on wound healing, markers of inflammation, glycemic control, amputation rate, survival rate of tissue, and health-related quality of life in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 38 patients with nonhealing DFUs who were deemed poor candidates for vascular surgery. Subjects were randomly allocated to an experimental group (standard care plus HBOT, n = 20) or a control group (standard care alone, n = 18). The study setting was a medical center in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. METHODS: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administered in a hyperbaric chamber under 2.5 absolute atmospheric pressure for 120 minutes; subjects were treated 5 days a week for 4 consecutive weeks. Both groups received standard wound care including debridement of necrotic tissue, topical therapy for Wagner grade 2 DFUs, dietary control and pharmacotherapy to maintain optimal blood glucose levels. Wound physiological indices were measured and blood tests (eg, markers of inflammation) were undertaken. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form. RESULTS: Complete DFU closure was achieved in 5 patients (25%) in the HBOT group (n = 20) versus 1 participant (5.5%) in the routine care group (n = 18) (P =.001). The amputation rate was 5% for the HBOT group and 11% for the routine care group (χ2 = 15.204, P =.010). The HBOT group showed statistically significant improvements in inflammation index, blood flow, and health-related quality of life from pretreatment to 2 weeks after the last therapy ended (P <.05). Hemoglobin A1c was significantly lower in the HBOT group following treatment (P <.05) but not in the routine care group. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive HBOT improved wound healing in persons with DFU. Therapy also reduced the risk of amputation of the affected limb. We assert that at least 20 HBOT sessions are required to be effective.  MP: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be used as an adjunct to standard wound care in the treatment of diabetic patients with foot ulcers. We undertook a prospective, randomized investigation of the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy versus standard therapy for the treatment of foot ulcers in diabetic patients. A number of demographic variables were analyzed in regard to wound healing. We noted that foot ulcers in patients in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group were more likely to heal, and were more likely to undergo amputation distal to the metatarsophalangeal joint compared with those patients receiving standard therapy without hyperbaric oxygen. We feel that hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be considered a useful adjunct in the management of foot ulcers in diabetic patients. Level of Clinical Evidence: 2.  MP: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy (s HBOT) in addition to a comprehensive protocol in decreasing major amputation rate in diabetic patients hospitalized for severe foot ulcer.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS From August 1993 to August 1995, 70 diabetic subjects were consecutively admitted into our diabetologic unit for foot ulcers. All the subjects underwent our diagnostic-therapeutic protocol and were randomized to undergo s-HBOT. Two subjects, one in the arm of the treated group and one in the arm of nontreated group, did not complete the protocol and were therefore excluded from the analysis of the results. Finally, 35 subjects received s-HBOT and another 33 did not.  RESULTS Of the treated group (mean session = 38.8 ± 8), three subjects (8.6%) underwent major amputation: two below the knee and one above the knee. In the nontreated group, 11 subjects (33.3%) underwent major amputation: 7 below the knee and 4 above the knee. The difference is statistically significant (P = 0.016). The relative risk for the treated group was 0.26 (95% CI 0.08–0.84). The transcutaneous oxygen tension measured on the dorsum of the foot significantly increased in subjects treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy: 14.0 ± 11.8 mmHg in treated group, 5.0 ± 5.4 mmHg in nontreated group (P = 0.0002). Multivariate analysis of major amputation on all the considered variables confirmed the protective role of s-HBOT (odds ratio 0.084, P = 0.033, 95% CI 0.008–0.821) and indicated as negative prognostic determinants low ankle-brachial index values (odds ratio 1.715, P = 0.013, 95% CI 1.121–2.626) and high Wagner grade (odds ratio 11.199, P = 0.022, 95% CI 1.406–89.146).  CONCLUSIONS s-HBOT, in conjunction with an aggressive multidisciplinary therapeutic protocol, is effective in decreasing major amputations in diabetic patients with severe prevalently ischemic foot ulcers.  MP: Background and Aims: Chronic diabetic foot ulcers pose a major problem because of associated limb threatening complications. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as an adjuvant to standard therapy for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Material and Methods: A total of 54 patients with diabetic foot ulcer of Wagner grade II-IV were recruited in this prospective, randomized, double blind study. Patients were randomized to receive HBOT along with standard therapy (group H; n = 28) or standard therapy alone (group S; n = 26). Patients were given 6 sessions per week for 6 weeks and followed up for 1 year. Outcomes were measured in terms of healing, and need for amputation, grafting or debridement. Parametric continuous variables were analyzed using Student unpaired t-test and categorical variables were analyzed using Chi square test. Results: The diabetic ulcers in 78% patients in Group H completely healed without any surgical intervention while no patient in group S healed without surgical intervention (P = 0.001). 2 patients in group H required distal amputation while in Group S, three patients underwent proximal amputation. Conclusion: The present study shows that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a useful adjuvant to standard therapy and is a better treatment modality if combined with standard treatment rather than standard treatment alone for management of diabetic foot ulcers.

"Objectives The goal of this systemic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the longevity of indirect adhesively-luted ceramic compared to conventionally cemented metal single tooth restorations.  Data Randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating indirect adhesively-luted ceramic restorations compared to metal or metal-based cemented restorations in permanent posterior teeth.  Sources Three electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane) and Embase) were screened. No language or time restrictions were applied. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were done in duplicate. Risk of Bias and level of evidence was graded using Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and Grade Profiler 3.6.  Results A total of 3056 articles were found by electronic databases. Finally, four RCTs were selected. Overall, 443 restorations of which 212 were adhesively-luted ceramic restorations and 231 conventionally cemented metal restorations have been placed in 314 patients (age: 22-72 years). The highest annual failure rates were found for ceramic restorations ranging from 2.1% to 5.6%. Lower annual failure rates were found for metal (gold) restorations ranging from 0% to 2.1%. Meta-analysis could be performed for adhesively-luted ceramic vs. conventionally cemented metal restorations. Conventionally cemented metal restoration showed a significantly lower failure rate than adhesively-luted ceramic ones (visual-tactile assessment: Risk Ratio (RR)[95%CI]=0.31[0.16,0.57], low level of evidence). Furthermore, all studies showed a high risk of bias.  Conclusion Conventionally cemented metal restorations revealed significantly lower failure rates compared to adhesively-luted ceramic ones, although the selected sample was small and with medium follow-up periods with high risks of bias.","MP: Purpose: The present follow-up study aimed to evaluate the clinical quality and longevity of 3 ceramic inlay systems and compare them with gold inlays. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients were treated with one Cerec, one Mirage, one Empress, and one gold inlay, respectively, inserted in a randomly selected order in the mandible. The inlays were examined independently by 2 calibrated examiners immediately after and 1, 3, and 5 years after luting. The inlays were rated using the California Dental Association (CDA) quality evaluation system. Results: Two Empress inlays required replacement because of fracture between examination (Ex) 1 and Ex 2, and 2 Empress inlays were fractured between Ex 3 and Ex 4. One Cerec inlay had to be recemented after 3 months, and one Cerec inlay fractured between Ex 3 and Ex 4 and was replaced with a gold inlay. Examination showed that the mismatch of color increased from 15% to 50% between Ex 1 and Ex 4 for all ceramic systems. Visible evidence of ditching along the margin increased from 5% at Ex 1 to 70% at Ex 4, and an apparent discoloration of the margin between the tooth and the restoration was seen in 0% to 5% at Ex 1 compared to 30% to 55% at Ex 4. Conclusion: Eight percent of the ceramic inlays were fractured during the follow-up period of 5 years. Based on the criteria of the CDA quality evaluation system, 92% of the 60 ceramic inlays and 100% of the 20 gold inlays were rated satisfactory 5 years after luting.  MP: Purpose: To investigate the long-term clinical performance of cast gold partial crowns (CGPCs) as compared to partial ceramic crowns (PCCs). The null hypothesis tested was that CGPCs and PCCs would show similar clinical outcomes. In the present evaluation, the 5.5 year results are reported. Methods: This was a controlled, prospective, clinical split-mouth study. In each patient, one CGPC (Degulor C) and one PCC (Vita Mark II ceramic/Cerec 3) had been inserted at baseline. After 5.5 years, 22 CGPC and 22 PCC restorations in 22 subjects attending the recall visit were clinically assessed using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival rates were calculated for CGPCs and PCCs of the 29 subjects who had been originally enrolled in the study. Results: 22 subjects (8 male, 14 female) participated in the 5.5-year recall with a total of 44 restorations. 22 CGPCs and 11 PCCs were placed in molars; 11 PCCs were placed in premolars. The median patient age was 37 years (32-44 years). All subjects revealed a papilla bleeding index (PBI) of < 20% (median: 7%). After 5.5 years, PCCs revealed a statistically significant, time dependant decrease of Alfa ratings for criteria anatomic form, marginal adaptation and marginal discoloration. Furthermore, PCCs as compared to CGPCs showed a statistically significant material-related decrease of Alfa ratings for criteria anatomic form and marginal discoloration. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a 93.3% cumulative survival rate for CGPCs and an 88.8% cumulative survival rate for PCCs after 5.5 years. Survival functions did not differ significantly across groups. At 5.5 years, CGPCs and PCCs exhibited satisfactory clinical outcomes. For PCCs, Bravo ratings increased significantly over time, however this did not compromise clinical survival of the restorations as compared to CGPCs.  MP: The aim of this prospective randomised controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the clinical outcome of shrinkage-free ZrSiO4-ceramic full-coverage crowns on premolars and molars in comparison with conventional gold crowns over a 5-year period. Two hundred and twenty-three patients were included and randomly divided into two treatment groups. One hundred and twenty-three patients were restored with 123 ZrSiO4-ceramic crowns, and 100 patients received 100 gold crowns, which served as the control. All crowns were conventionally cemented with glass–ionomer cement. After an observation period of 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months, the survival probability (Kaplan–Meier) for the shrinkage-free ZrSiO4-ceramic crowns was 98·3%, 92·0%, 84·7%, 79% and 73·2% and for the gold crowns, 99%, 97·9%, 95·7%, 94·6% and 92·3%, respectively. The difference between the test and control group was statistically significant (P = 0·0027). The gold crowns showed a better marginal integrity with less marginal discoloration than the ceramic crowns. The most common failure in the ceramic crown group was fracture of the crown. The 60-month results of this prospective randomised controlled clinical trial suggest that the use of these shrinkage-free ZrSiO4-ceramic crowns in posterior tooth restorations cannot be recommended.  MP: Cast gold partial crowns (CGPC) are an accepted means of restoring posterior teeth. For aesthetic reasons, gold alloys are being increasingly substituted with ceramics. The aim of the present study was to investigate retrospectively the long-term clinical performance and survival of CGPC and compare the results to the ones already reported for ceramic partial crowns (CPC). The CGPC group consisted of 42 patients (24 male, 18 female) randomly sampled from a total of 106 patients with CGPC, with one restoration per patient. The CPC group consisted of 22 patients with a total of 42 restorations. Both types of restoration were done by one experienced dentist. Another two experienced dentists who were not involved in performing the restorations rated both kinds of partial crowns using the modified United State Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria [14]. The Median age of the CGPC was 57 months (range 3-157) and of the CPC and 63 months (range 24-72). Forty-one (98%) of the CGPC and 27 (64%) of the CPC were placed in molars, the rest in premolars. In each group, 40 (95%) restorations were still functioning without any necessity of replacement. Two teeth with CGPC, in situ for 4.5 and 11 years, respectively, had been extracted for periodontal reasons. Two CPC fractured and had to be replaced after 2 and 6.5 years in situ. The USPHS criteria results were similarly good for the gold and ceramic groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed survival probabilities of 72+/-21% and 96+/-4% after 13 and 7 years, respectively, for the CGPC. Survival of the CPC was 81+/-15% after 7 years. No statistically significant difference among survival functions of CGPC and CPC was found. From this data, it can be concluded that the longevity of CPC is not inferior to that of gold alloys. However, more long-term studies comparing the clinical performance and longevity of these two types of indirect restoration in the posterior region with larger numbers of restorations are desirable."
"Objectives Childhood anorexia, among the commonest symptoms of children, involved long-term loss of appetite/decreased food intake and refusal to try or eat certain foods. Acupuncture is increasingly popular in childhood anorexia due to the side effects and dissatisfaction of conventional treatment, but, the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for childhood anorexia have not been reviewed systematically.  Methods From 12 electronic databases, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing acupuncture for childhood anorexia were identified in June 2021, with posttreatment improvement in clinical symptoms of anorexia as the primary outcome. A meta-analysis was conducted if two or more studies used the same interventions or same outcome measures. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were evaluated.  Results A total of 32 RCTs with 3518 participants were included. When acupuncture was used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the total effectiveness rate based on anorexia symptoms, hemoglobin levels, abdominal subcutaneous fat, and body weight significantly improved. However, results in nutritional indices were inconsistent. The recurrence rate of anorexia was significantly lower in the acupuncture group. No serious adverse events in relation to acupuncture were reported. in general, the risk of bias of the included studies was unclear and the quality of evidence for the main findings was low to moderate.  Conclusions Acupuncture may improve symptoms of childhood anorexia without serious adverse events. However, because of the low methodological quality and quality of evidence in existing reports, further high-quality clinical trials are needed to conclusively establish the efficacy and safety of this treatment.","MP: Objectives Childhood anorexia, among the commonest symptoms of children, involved long-term loss of appetite/decreased food intake and refusal to try or eat certain foods.

Methods From 12 electronic databases, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing acupuncture for childhood anorexia were identified in June 2021, with posttreatment improvement in clinical symptoms of anorexia as the primary outcome. A meta-analysis was conducted if two or more studies used the same interventions or same outcome measures. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were evaluated.  Results A total of 32 RCTs with 3518 participants were included. When acupuncture was used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the total effectiveness rate based on anorexia symptoms, hemoglobin levels, abdominal subcutaneous fat, and body weight significantly improved. However, results in nutritional indices were inconsistent. The recurrence rate of anorexia was significantly lower in the acupuncture group. No serious adverse events in relation to acupuncture were reported. in general, the risk of bias of the included studies was unclear and the quality of evidence for the main findings was low to moderate.  Conclusions Acupuncture may improve symptoms of childhood anorexia without serious adverse events. However, because of the low methodological quality and quality of evidence in existing reports, further high-quality clinical trials are needed to conclusively establish the efficacy and safety of this treatment.  MP: With the fast growth of civil drones, their security problems meet significant challenges. A commercial drone may be hijacked by a GPS-spoofing attack for illegal activities, such as terrorist attacks. The target of this article is to develop a technique that only uses onboard gyroscopes to determine whether a drone has been hijacked. Ideally, GPS data and the angular velocities measured by gyroscopes can be used to estimate the acceleration of a drone, which can be further compared with the measurement of the accelerometer to detect whether a drone has been hijacked. However, the detection results may not always be accurate due to some calculation and measurement errors, especially when no hijacking occurs in curve trajectory situations. To overcome this, in this article, we propose a novel and simple method to detect hijacking only based on gyroscopes' measurements and GPS data, without using any accelerometer in the detection procedure. The computational complexity of our method is very low, which is suitable to be implemented in the drones with micro-controllers. On the other hand, the proposed method does not rely on any accelerometer to detect attacks, which means it receives less information in the detection procedure and may reduce the results accuracy in some special situations. While the previous method can compensate for this flaw, the high detection results also can be guaranteed by using the above two methods. Experiments with a quad-rotor drone are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the combination method.  MP: The gap between the advances and the utilization of deep submicron (DSM) technology is increasing as the new generation of technology is introduced faster than ever. Signal integrity is one of the most important issues in overcoming this gap. With the increasing coupling capacitance between the high aspect ratio wires, the delay uncertainty is unpredictable in the current design flow. We present an algorithm to generate a global wire bus configuration with minimum delay uncertainty under timing constraints. The timing window information from the timing budget (or specified in IPs) is integrated with modern accurate crosstalk noise models in the proposed algorithm. HSPICE simulations show that the algorithm is very effective and efficient when compared to the buffer insertion scheme with minimum delay. The standard deviation of the delay obtained from the Monte-Carlo simulation is improved by up to 73%. This global wire bus configuration can be adopted in early wire planning to improve the timing closure problem and increase the accuracy of the timing budget.  MP: Slope-tunable Si nanorod arrays (NRAs) were fabricated with colloidal lithography and reactive ion etching (RIE). Sharpened NRAs fabricated by increasing the SF6/O2 flow ratio during RIE exhibit enhanced antireflection (AR) and hydrophobic properties, which are attributed to the smooth gradient in the effective refractive index of NRAs, and the enlarged water/air interface of the water drops in the NRA layers, respectively. Enhanced AR characteristics via modifying the slope of NRAs are accompanied by broad-band working ranges, omnidirectionality, and polarization insensitivity. Detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of slope-tunable NRAs should benefit the development of various self-cleaning optoelectronic devices with efficient light management.  MP: High quality single crystal sapphire optical fiber is important not only for its capacity for high laser power delivery, but also for applications in harsh environment sensing. Improving the quality of Laser Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) fabricated single crystal fiber has been a long-term effort for decades. The equilibrium state during crystal growth and defect formation rate are the two most important factors in single crystal fiber fabrication. In this paper, we study the theory governing the molten zone profile and verify the theoretical predictions with a high-resolution CCD camera. We also study defect formation during the crystal growth process and observed dislocation defects with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These analyses will help to guide high quality single crystal fiber fabrication and hopefully will lead to the production of better fibers for harsh-environment sensing applications.  MP: China has participated in the WTO for ten years. It can be divided into two stages, which have different features for the first five years and the second five years. As China has become the new emerging power in the WTO, many comments have focused on its participation in the WTO, especially its practice in the DSM. China, as a new member in the WTO, is not very aggressive, and all the challenges and issues to be settled largely depend on its participation capacity in the WTO.  MP: Although membrane bioreactor is widely used in wastewater treatment, the problem of membrane fouling remains to be resolved. This paper focused on the influence of mechanical stirring on membrane fouling. Ammonium removal decreased with viscous bulking when stirring rates slowed down. Trans-membrane pressure increased more rapidly when the stirring rate decreased. The resistance of the gel layer increased significantly under low stirring rates, which indicated that the fouling rates of MBR in different stages were attributed to gel layer variation. The proportion of small particles increased when stirring rates slowed down. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant in the mixed liquor. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased from 41% to 50% in the entire experiment. The computational fluid dynamics model was used to simulate the fluid flow characteristics. The model indicated velocities and directions of the fluid flow changes with different stirring rates.   MP: Background Pediatric tuina is used to prevent and treat disease by employing various manipulative techniques on specific parts of the body, appropriate to the child’s specific physiological and pathological characteristics.  Objective To evaluate the effects and safety of pediatric tuina as a non-pharmaceutical therapy for anorexia in children under 14 years.  Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pediatric tuina with medicine for anorexia were included in this review. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2019. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Significant effective rate (defined as appetite improved and food intake returning to 3/4 or more of normal intake) was used as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included food intake, compliance and adverse events. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to calculate the required information size in a meta-analysis and to detect the robustness of the results. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool.  Results Of the included 28 RCTs involving 2650 children, the majority had a high or unclear risk of bias in terms of allocation concealment, blinding, and selective reporting. All trials compared tuina with western medicine or Chinese herbs. For significant effective rate, meta-analysis showed that tuina was superior to western medicine (risk ratio (RR) 1.68, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [1.35, 2.08]) and Chinese herbs (RR 1.36, 95 % CI [1.19, 1.55]). For food intake, 9 trials evaluated it in the form of score (1 points, 2 points, 4 points and 6 points) calculated according to the reduction degree of food intake. Six points represented the most serious. Meta-analysis showed tuina was superior to western medicine (mean difference (MD) -0.88, 95 % CI [-1.27, -0.50]) and Chinese herbs (MD -0.69, 95 % CI [-1.00, -0.38]) on lightening the reduction degree of food intake. Two trials reported compliance and six trials reported no adverse events occurred in pediatric tuina group. TSA for significant effective rate demonstrated that the pooled data had insufficient power regarding both numbers of trials and participants.  Conclusions Low certainty of evidence suggested pediatric tuina was beneficial and safe for the treatment of anorexia in children under 14 years. Furthermore well-designed RCTs with adequate sample sizes are needed.  MP: Objective: To search for an effective therapy for infantile anorexia.  Methods: Sixty-two cases of infantile anorexia were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group, 31 cases in each group. The treatment group were treated with chiropractics plus acupuncture at Sifeng (EX-UE 10), and the control group with oral administration of zinc gluconate granules made by the pharmaceutical factory of the hospital, for 2 weeks.  Results: The effective rate was 93.5% in the treatment group, which was better than 74.2% in the control group (P < 0.05); there were significant differences in blood zinc content and urinary amylase activity in the two groups before and after treatment (P < 0.01), with more significant increase in the treatment group as compared with the control group (P < 0.05).  Conclusion: Chiropractics combined with acupuncture at Sifeng (EX-UE 10) has a better therapeutic effect on infantile anorexia.  MP: Theoretical understanding of the nucleus structures of hybrid perovskites, such as those of the prototypical methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3), can greatly improve the deposited thin film quality and the resulting optoelectronic device performance. In this paper, we report a systematic molecular dynamics simulation study on nucleation and interfacial mismatch during the vapor deposition of MAPbI3 on the TiO2 substrate under different ionic precursor (PbI2 and MAI salts) compositions and temperatures. Despite significant anisotropic lattice mismatches, small defects are observed at the TiO2/[MAI]0 interface due to intermediate electrostatic attractions between I and Ti atoms, while very strong electrostatic attractions between Pb and O atoms lead to significant defects at the TiO2/[PbI2]0 interface. From the vapor deposition simulations, we identify PbI42– tetrahedra, PbI53– pyramids, and PbI64– octahedra as dominant polyhedral building blocks of early MAPbI3 nuclei. Specifically, the PbI53– pyramids dominate over other polyhedra and could be a good candidate for converting into PbI64– octahedra upon further crystallization. We further identify early MAPbI3 nuclei built upon well-connected PbIx polyhedral clusters and finally locate the efficient early MAPbI3 nuclei based on sufficient amounts of surrounding MA+ cations. The populations of these early nuclei increase rapidly with increasing the MAI composition, suggesting that potential improvements in film quality could be introduced by depositing more MAI salts or MA+ cations, a finding consistent with experiments. Although the impact from temperature is weaker than that from composition, the optimal temperature for nucleation is found to decrease with increasing the precursor composition PbI2/MAI. Finally, the TiO2 substrate leads to layered structures of ionic species close to its surface, but such ordering does not seem to promote prenucleation, which poses a need for the new design of substrates that are more compatible with PbI64–-based early nuclei.  MP: Web-based autonomous language learning system enjoys great popularity among college English learners in China. It provides abundant educational resources for the learner. Efficient use of available materials on the system needs intelligent resources recommendation and personalized guidance in learning strategies. This paper uses the data mining technology to build an automatic recommendation agent to enhance the function of web-based autonomous language learning system. The automatic recommendation agent serves two functions. One is to push related resources to the learner based on the results from association rule mining of all users' resource navigation patterns. The other is to provide immediate and individualized guidance for the learner concerning strategies of online language learning. The knowledge of personalized guidance comes from the machine learning of strategies adopted by students with varied level of achievements in language learning. The framework and data structure of its implementation have been presented in this paper. Experiments show that the automatic recommendation agent improves the management of educational resources on web-based autonomous language learning system and better facilitate students' language learning.   MP: OBJECTIVE: To observe effect of acupuncture at Sifeng (EX-UE 10) on serum leptin level in the child of anorexia, so as to reveal relation between changes of blood leptin level and anorexia of child. METHODS: Forty-two cases were randomly divided into 3 groups. The treatment group A (n = 15) were treated with acupuncture at Sifeng (EX-UE 10), once each week, 3 consecutive sessions constituting one course; the treatment group B (n = 15) were treated with acupuncture at Sifeng (EX-UE 10), once two weeks, 3 consecutive sessions constituting one course; the medication group (n = 12) were treated with oral administration of Lactein tablets, 1 - 2 tablets each time, 3 times each day, 4 weeks constituting one course. RESULTS: The effective rate was 93.3% in the treatment group A and 93.3% in the treatment group B, which were higher than that in the medication group, with a very significant differences (P < 0.01); after treatment, the serum leptin levels in the 3 groups had very significant changes (P < 0.01); the improvement of serum leptin levels in the treatment group A and B were better than that in the medication group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at Sifeng (EX-UE 10) can promote secretion of serum leptin in the child of anorexia, and improve anorexia."
"Background Everyday sadism is unique among the dark personality traits that form the Dark Tetrad. Whilst it shares the Dark Core of Personality with psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism, it is theoretically distinct from the other members in that involves an appetite for cruelty.  Objective Given mounting evidence of everyday sadism being associated with socially aversive behaviour, and its potential utility in predicting harmful behaviour within the general population; the current review examined the relationship between sadism and aggressive behaviour.  Data sources Seven well-established electronic bibliographic databases and two other sources were systematically searched. Supplementary searches were employed.  Study selection The initial search identified 627 full-text articles. Following application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 full-text articles inclusive of 52 studies were subject to quality assessment. Data was extracted from 52 studies, with 48 studies eligible for quantitative synthesis.  Data synthesis Correlational analyses were the most common method of examining sadism and aggression. A multi-method approach was employed to standardize effect sizes into a common metric (correlation coefficient). A meta-analysis was conducted using 57 effect sizes from 48 studies with 22,179 participants, revealing a pooled correlation coefficient of 0.35 (95% CI = 0.29, 0.40). Significant heterogeneity was observed which warranted sensitivity and subgroup analyses.  Conclusions Overall, a moderate relationship was found between subclinical sadism and aggressive behaviour, as defined by acts ranging from verbal to physical, and sexual aggression and violence. A stronger, moderate relationship was found between sadism and perpetration of aggressive behaviour online, indicating that anonymity may unleash the darker side of personality within the general population. The implications of this finding are considered.","MP: This study investigated whether dark tetrad personalities (psychopathy, machiavellianism, narcissism, and sadism) can predict hazing behaviors, whether Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) has a mediating role between these variables, and whether group cooperation level and personal role in a group can also predict hazing behaviors. For this project, 416 students at Texas State University were recruited via the Human Subjects Pool webpage created by the Department of Psychology. These participants completed an online survey including scales for the previously mentioned variables. Statistical analyses showed that males tended to favor more severe hazing behaviors than females and that the level of group cooperation also predicted hazing severity. Furthermore, SDO did not act as a mediator between dark personalities and hazing behaviors. However, machiavellianism, sadism, and SDO predicted severe hazing. Lastly, machiavellianism and sadism acted as moderators in the relation between SDO and hazing behaviors while controlling for the effects of gender and group cooperation. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.  MP: Although psychological conceptions of sadism have traditionally viewed it as a clinical-forensic disorder, there is emerging scientific interest in the view that sadism extends to the normal range of personality. Sadistic personality is defined as an enduring tendency to enjoy cruelty toward others. To capture the full scope of this trait, I constructed and validated a self-report questionnaire—the Comprehensive Assessment of Sadistic Tendencies (CAST)—designed to assess three overlapping, but distinct facets of sadism, covering enjoyment of physical violence, verbal aggression, and violent media consumption. As part of the psychometric evaluation and validation process (Chapter 2), I administered the CAST to multiple samples of university students and community adults (total N= 5,553). Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the CAST’s three-factor structure. The instrument produced excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability estimates. Overall CAST scores were positively associated with other malevolent traits (including aggression and the Dark Triad of personality: psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism), and negatively associated with prosocial traits such as empathy. Convergent validity was demonstrated by high correlations between CAST scores and those of alternative unidimensional sadism measures. Discriminant validity was evident in the CAST’s lack of association with theoretically unrelated constructs such as emotional stability. Subsequent research (Chapters 3-5) demonstrated the predictive and incremental validity of the CAST, including the unique contributions of the three subscales. In Chapter 3 (total N= 2,779), sadism was a strong positive predictor of online trolling behavior (which was, in turn, distinguishable from cyberbullying). In Chapter 4 (N= 412), sadism predicted a pattern of inaccurate and negative interpersonal perceptions, with effects emerging for both sadistic perceivers and sadistic targets. In Chapter 5 (total N= 540), sadism predicted tendencies to underestimate others’ suffering and minimize culpability for harm; both effects were statistically explained by positive affect. Taken together, the results support the construct validity of sadistic personality, and the inclusion of sadism in new “Dark Tetrad” of personality.  MP: Past research on socially aversive personalities has focused on subclinical psychopathy, subclinical narcissism, and Machiavellianism-the ""Dark Triad"" of personality. In the research reported here, we evaluated whether an everyday form of sadism should be added to that list. Acts of apparent cruelty were captured using two laboratory procedures, and we showed that such behavior could be predicted with two measures of sadistic personality. Study 1 featured a bug-killing paradigm. As expected, sadists volunteered to kill bugs at greater rates than did nonsadists. Study 2 examined willingness to harm an innocent victim. When aggression was easy, sadism and Dark Triad measures predicted unprovoked aggression. However, only sadists were willing to work for the opportunity to hurt an innocent person. In both studies, sadism emerged as an independent predictor of behavior reflecting an appetite for cruelty. Together, these findings support the construct validity of everyday sadism and its incorporation into a new ""Dark Tetrad"" of personality.  MP: Narcissistic, psychopathic, and Machiavellian personality traits have been reported to be three distinct but empirically over-lapping traits called the Dark Triad. Recently, sadistic traits were added to this trio of personality and it became labeled the Dark Tetrad of personality traits. As the Dark Triad has been suggested to be a single Dark Core of personality, additional research is needed to test whether or not the concept of a Dark Core remains relevant when considering both sadism and borderline personality traits. The aim of the study was to assess the contribution of Dark Tetrad traits to antisocial behaviors in a community sample of 511 college students. While controlling for borderline personality traits, and frequency of substance, a multiple regression analysis showed that psychopathic and sadistic traits were unique predictors of antisocial behavior in both genders. Machiavellian and narcissistic traits did not appear to independently contribute to antisocial behavior. While not significant in this variable-centered study, exploring the association of borderline personality traits with the Dark Tetrad using a person-centered approach is warranted and further studies beyond the Dark Tetrad need to be developed.  MP: Women’s religious radicalization and the specific factors at play in this process remain largely understudied. Psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic traits constitute the Dark Tetrad of personality, which has been shown to be associated with several antisocial tendencies. Concretely, it has been found that the Dark Tetrad traits predict radicalized cognitions and behaviors in women. The aim of this study was (a) to extract homogeneous groups of participants using cluster analysis based on Dark tetrad traits and (b) to examine whether clusters based on Dark tetrad traits differed in both predictors (perceived discrimination and religious involvement) and consequences (radicalized cognitions and behaviors) of radicalization. Sample included 643 French college women who completed self-report questionnaires. Psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic traits were moderately correlated. The cluster analysis resulted in four groups: a Low Traits group, a Moderate Machiavellian group, a Narcissistic group, and a group high on sadistic, psychopathic and Machiavellian traits (17% of the sample), which was characterized by the highest levels of radicalized cognitions and behaviors. This study suggests that a significant minority of non-clinical college women is characterized by the presence of high levels of Dark Tetrad traits and is at risk of religious radicalization.  MP: Sadism is a “dark” trait that involves the experience of pleasure from others’ pain, yet much is unknown about its link to aggression. Across eight studies (total N = 2,255), sadism predicted greater aggression against both innocent targets and provocateurs. These associations occurred above-and-beyond general aggressiveness, impulsivity, and other “dark” traits. Sadism was associated with greater positive affect during aggression, which accounted for much of the variance in the sadism–aggression link. This aggressive pleasure was contingent on sadists’ perceptions that their target suffered due to their aggressive act. After aggression, sadism was associated with increases in negative affect. Sadism thus appears to be a potent predictor of aggression that is motivated by the pleasure of causing pain. Such sadistic aggression ultimately backfires, resulting in greater negative affect. More generally, our results support the crucial role of anticipated and positive forms of affect in motivating aggression.  MP: The aim of this research was to determine whether the person-centered or the variable- centered approach is better at describing the covariance between the Dark Triad and Dark Tetrad traits in the community sample. On the sample of 624 participants (48.2% males), the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen (DTDD), the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale (SSIS) and the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies Scale (VAST) were used for measuring the dark traits, while the Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) and the questions about alcohol use were applied for criteria validation. In order to test whether the variable– or the person-centered approach better described covariance among the dark traits, the latent profile analysis was used. The results revealed one profile or two quantitatively different profiles (low and high dark traits), suggesting that the variable-centered approach is more appropriate than the person-centered for describing the dark traits. In the case of the Dark Tetrad, profile membership largely depended on the used sadism measure, i.e. profile agreement was moderate. High dark traits profile based on the combination with the SSIS sadism scale was characterized by both higher aggression and alcohol use, while the same profile based on the combination with the VAST sadism measure was characterized only by higher aggression.

MP: Using life history theory, we provided (N = 1236) insight into individual differences in the engagement in human vice or sin (e.g., lust) by examining individual differences in dark personality traits and morality. Moral foundations were associated with sin through the individualizing aspects of morality. Dark personality traits accounted for almost six times more variance in individual differences in sinning than the moral foundations which suggests that it is personality rather than morality that is responsible for sinning behaviors. While sadism and spitefulness accounted for unique and significantly more variance, this was a small and specialized amount. We replicated effects suggesting men are more strongly embodied by dark personality traits and behaviors than women are, and women are more morally virtuous than men are, but showed these sex differences were a function of dark personality traits—in particular—and moral foundations. Overwhelmingly, dark personality traits trump participant’ sex and moral foundations in accounting for variance in sin.  MP: The dark triad created by Paulhus and Williams (2002) is relatively new to research and requires a more thorough investigation. One area of expansion is considering the addition of everyday sadism to the dark triad thus making the dark tetrad. Investigating the relationship between the dark tetrad and the Personality Inventory for the DSM-5 (PID-5) could greatly add to the existing understanding as well. Lastly, there is a need for further clarification of the relationship between the dark tetrad and sexual tactics. The current study investigated each of these areas. From this examination, it was found that sadism could be validly added to the dark triad. Furthermore, the PID-5 antagonism domain and facets correlated moderately to strongly with the dark tetrad traits. Lastly, most of the dark tetrad traits were found to have a statistically significant relationship with sexual coercion and psychopathy alone had a significant relationship with sexual coaxing. Overall, the current study adds promising information to existing research by defining the dark tetrad using maladaptive traits and examining their relations with sexually deviant behaviors.  MP: Implied precedence (i.e., the persons involved having had a prior sexual relationship) increases sexual coaxing and coercion (SCC). We examined whether General personality, the Dark Tetrad (Psychopathy, Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Sadism) and mating effort, influenced this association. HEXACO personality, Mating Effort (ME), Short Dark Triad (SD3), Sadism, and Tactics to Obtain Sex Scale (TOSS) measures were completed by 151 participants (M:F:Other = 45:103:3; mean age = 31.97, SD = 11.6). Coaxing varied more than coercion, but wasn’t affected by gender or gender-intimacy interaction. Propensity for SCC with a current partner was higher than for an ex-partner or a neighbour, and for an ex-partner compared to a neighbour. SD3, sadism, and ME scores correlated with TOSS scores. Emotionality, Machiavellianism, and ME constructs significantly predicted coaxing, but only ME uniquely predicted coercion. These results suggest individual factors to consider in relationship advisory services and campaigns.  MP: The space of immoral, deceitful and antisocial personality dispositions has been usually depicted by the Dark Triad concept, consisted of psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism. Recently, a trait of sadism (enjoyment in pain of others) has been added into the concept, thus forming the Dark Tetrad. In the present research, we tried to expand the nomological network of dark traits by exploring their relations with cynicism, aggressive humor and attitudes towards immigrants (operationalized as realistic and symbolic threat). The research has been conducted on a community sample (N=341) via on line study. Study results showed that all of the criteria variables have been successfully predicted by the Dark Tetrad traits, however, the percentages of explained variance largely differed: R²s ranged from .11 (for symbolic threat) to .38 (for aggressive humor). Factor analysis showed that aggressive humor and cynicism can be largely viewed as expressions of the dark personality traits, while negative attitudes towards immigrants can be best conceptualized as a correlate of the Dark Tetrad. Research findings provided deeper insight into the motivational basis for cynicism and aggressive humor and revealed new possible dispositions for antagonism towards immigrants.  MP: Football (soccer) fans, particularly those with active involvement in supporting clubs, are especially prone to violence and criminal behavior. However, there is a gap in literature regarding individual characteristics which lead to criminal behavior in this group. In the present research, we examined the Dark Tetrad traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) and criminal attitudes (Violence, Entitlement, Antisocial intent, and Associates) in a group of active football fans (N= 128) and a control group (N= 118). We were led by a hypothesis that psychopathy and sadism as the dark traits with highest associations with violence are more pronounced in football supporters and key traits to predict criminal attitudes. The results showed that football fans had higher scores in all criminal attitude scales as well as in trait sadism. Furthermore, membership in a football supporters’ group was the most important predictor of all four measures of criminal attitudes. However, Dark Tetrad traits contributed to the prediction as well: sadism was the most important predictor of criminal attitudes, followed by psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, while narcissism had the fewest associations with the criteria measures. Finally, sadism was the only dark trait which significantly mediated the link between club supporting and criminal attitudes. Study findings help in understanding personality profiles of football supporters and provide new knowledge of the role that the Dark Tetrad traits (especially sadism) play in violence and criminal involvement in general.  MP: Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy are personality traits understood to be dispositions toward amoral and antisocial behavior. Recent research has suggested that sadism should also be added to this set of traits. In the present study, we tested a hypothesis proposing that these four traits are expressions of one superordinate construct: The Dark Tetrad. Exploration of the latent space of four ""dark"" traits suggested that the singular second-order factor which represents the Dark Tetrad can be extracted. Analysis has shown that Dark Tetrad traits can be located in the space of basic personality traits, especially on the negative pole of the Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotionality dimensions. We conclude that sadism behaves in a similar manner as the other dark traits, but it cannot be reduced to them. The results support the concept of ""Dark Tetrad"".   MP: Women’s radicalization is a pending issue in empirical research that is worthy of attention. It has been found that the role of women in international terrorism is much greater than previously thought, but we know almost nothing about the factors underlying the process that would lead them to perpetrate radicalized acts, as almost no empirical research has been carried out on the subject. In this work we aim to explore a model of radicalization of thought and action among young women. The hypothesized model included ten predictors: cultural identity, cultural discrimination, religious involvement, depressive symptoms, and schizotypal, borderline, and the Dark Tetrad traits of personality. Dogmatism was hypothesized as a mediator between these factors and the level of radicalized cognitions and behaviors. The sample comprises 643 college women (aged 18 to 29) from French universities. Our results suggest that women becoming involved in radicalization are more “dark” than “disturbed.” Schizotypal, borderline, and depressive features, although being associated to radicalization, do not contribute to the model. Both the dark traits and socio-cultural factors are revealed as predictors of radicalization, while dogmatism is clearly shown as a mediator. Orientations in terms of prevention among young women are proposed.  MP: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health issue defined by the infliction of physical, psychological, and/or sexual harm to a partner or spouse. Given its extreme health consequences, it is imperative that researchers better understand individual difference factors underlying IPV. The purpose of the following studies was to evaluate whether the Dark Tetrad of personality moderated relationships between participants’ and partners’ IPV perpetration. The first sample were 109 men and 290 women (age range = 17–33, Mage = 18.74, SDage = 1.84) recruited through the psychology participant pool at a Canadian university. Results showed that the relationships between participants’ and partners’ frequency of IPV varied depending on levels of Dark Tetrad traits. Participants in Study 2 were 153 men and 207 women recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (age range = 18–73, Mage = 34.39, SDage = 10.96). Results showed that being female, partner IPV perpetration severity, and Factor 2 psychopathy significantly increased odds of engaging in more severe IPV perpetration. Results from these studies could have implications for future implementation of appropriate interventions in the context of IPV perpetration. It is also important to implement better education on individual differences as mechanisms underlying IPV perpetration for society as a whole.  MP: Sexual violence research tends to focus on male aggressors and coercers, but females also commit sexual assault. This research tested whether female sexual violence perpetrated against men was predicted by maladaptive personality traits and adversarial sexual attitudes in a university (n = 439) and national (n = 592) sample. Overall, 10% of women reported sexual violence perpetration, but the national sample rates (13%) were more than twice as high as student rates (6%). This pattern was mirrored in all forms of sexual violence, and national women reported completed rape four times more often than did students. The rate spike in the older, more diverse population may be due to limited prevention efforts, and it emphasizes the importance of collecting data in multiple populations.  A structural equation model predicting sexual violence was also constructed with the university sample. Maladaptive personality traits predicted adversarial sexual attitudes. Adversarial sexual attitudes mediated the relationship between the personality traits and sexual violence. The model was replicated in the national sample. The profile from this model is that of a hostile, eccentric, and grandiose woman prone to abnormal beliefs. These women may enjoy controlling men, and they appear to view sex as a competition rather than an expression of affection.  MP: Sexual violence research tends to focus on male aggressors and coercers, but females also commit sexual assault. This research tested whether female sexual violence perpetrated against men was predicted by maladaptive personality traits and adversarial sexual attitudes in a university (n = 439) and national (n = 592) sample. Overall, 10% of women reported sexual violence perpetration, but the national sample rates (13%) were more than twice as high as student rates (6%). This pattern was mirrored in all forms of sexual violence, and national women reported completed rape four times more often than did students. The rate spike in the older, more diverse population may be due to limited prevention efforts, and it emphasizes the importance of collecting data in multiple populations. A structural equation model predicting sexual violence was also constructed with the university sample. Maladaptive personality traits predicted adversarial sexual attitudes. Adversarial sexual attitudes mediated the relationship between the personality traits and sexual violence. The model was replicated in the national sample. The profile from this model is that of a hostile, eccentric, and grandiose woman prone to abnormal beliefs. These women may enjoy controlling men, and they appear to view sex as a competition rather than an expression of affection.  MP:"
"Objects Radiotherapy (RT) serves as the most effective treatment for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) and can cause carotid stenosis. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of RT on carotid stenosis in NPC patients, as well as to explore the risk factors for significant carotid stenosis.  Methods Studies reporting the carotid stenosis in NPC patients who underwent RT were found on PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Outcomes of our interest included incidence of overall/significant stenosis, Common Carotid Artery (CCA) stenosis, External Carotid Artery (ECA) stenosis, Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) stenosis, and risk factors for significant carotid stenosis.  Results Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled estimate showed that RT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of overall stenosis (Risk Ratio [RR = 3.53], 95% CI: 2.32‒5.37; p <  0.001) and significant stenosis (RR = 7.06, 95% CI: 3.61‒13.79; p <  0.001) as compared with controls. Moreover, patients treated with RT had a significantly higher risk of stenosis in CCA (RR = 6.87, 95% CI: 4.08‒11.58; p <  0.001), ICA (RR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.35‒8.73; p =  0.010), ECA (RR = 9.37, 95% CI: 2.06‒42.68; p =  0.004), and ECA/ICA (RR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.52‒3.13; p < 0.001). Meta-analysis indicated that age (RR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.05‒2.04; p =  0.024), smoking habit (RR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02‒2.78; p =  0.045) and time interval from radiotherapy (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.07‒2.28; p =  0.02) were independent predictors of significant carotid stenosis.  Conclusion Our results suggested that RT increased the risk of carotid stenosis in patients with NPC. Prevention and control measurements should be made for older NPC patients with longer interval from RT, especially those with smoking habit.","MP: Objective: To investigate the incidence of carotid artery (CA) and vertebral artery (VA) stenosis by contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy.  Methods: 72 patients with NPC after radiotherapy more than 3 years ago were recruited as irradiation group to investigate the incidence and degree of CA and VA stenosis by CE-MRA. The results were compared with those of the control group, which comprised 50 newly diagnosed patients with NPC who had not received radiotherapy.  Results: There was a higher incidence of CA and VA stenosis in the irradiation group than in the control group in terms of patient number as well as vessel involvement. The incidence of significant (>50%) CA and VA stenosis, except for the basilar artery, was also higher in the irradiation group than in the control group. The most commonly detected stenosis in the irradiation group was found in the internal CA (ICA) and VA, followed by the external CA and common CA (CCA). CCA and/or ICA (CCA/ICA) stenosis was present in 67 (93.1%) of 72 patients, with 27 (37.5%) patients having significant CCA/ICA stenosis. The statistical analysis demonstrated that age at receiving CE-MRA scanning and time interval from radiotherapy were the independent predictors of significant CCA/ICA stenosis.  Conclusion: The CE-MRA scanning results showed that the incidence of stenosis seems to exist in a wider range of CAs and VAs in the patients with NPC after radiotherapy than in the patients who had not received radiotherapy, and the incidence of significant CCA/ICA stenosis is higher in patients with older age and longer interval from radiotherapy.  Advances in knowledge: Radiation-induced CA and VA stenosis exists widely in patients with NPC after radiotherapy, and its prevalence is more common in patients with older age and longer interval from radiotherapy.  MP: Objective: To study the prevalence of and risk factors associated with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) after radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer. Methods: Design of study: Prospective, cross-sectional study. Setting: Patients recruited from a hospital Radiation-Oncology department. Subjects: From March 2002 to August 2006, 290 consecutive head and neck cancer patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred ninety-two of these patients had previously undergone RT (RT group) and 98 had no RT (control group). Intervention: After detecting CAS by carotid duplex sonography, the severity of CAS was evaluated by a bilateral plaque scoring system. Main outcome measure: CAS score. Results: There were no differences in age or gender between the two groups. The RT group had a significantly higher plaque score than the non-irradiated group (P < .05). Multiple regression analysis of the 290 head and neck cancer patients revealed that bilateral plaque score was significantly correlated with age, hyperlipidemia, and RT. Multiple regression analysis was performed in the RT group alone with patients 41-50 years old serving as the reference group. This analysis showed that in RT patients > 50 years old, age was inversely correlated with plaque score; however, in RT patients ≤ 41 years old, age was positively correlated with plaque score. Conclusion: In head and neck cancer, the high post-treatment incidence of radiation-induced CAS indicates the importance of regular examination of the carotid duplex and early antiplatelet prophylaxis. Different age groups may require different irradiation strategies to prevent radiation-induced CAS.  MP: Background: Carotid stenosis is a recognized complication of external irradiation to the head and neck for malignancy. This study aim to investigate the pattern and prevalence of radiation induced carotid disease, and to identify risk factors associated with significant stenosis. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional study, carotid arteries color flow duplex scan was performed on 240 patients who had received external irradiation to the head and neck area, with a mean interval of 72 months from radiotherapy. They consisted of 181 men and 59 women, with a mean age of 59 years. Fifteen patients had a history of cerebrovascular symptoms. Results: Internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis of 70% or greater was detected in 29 arteries in 24 patients. Common carotid artery (CCA) disease of ≥70% was present in 13 arteries in 12 patients. Overall 28 patients had significant ICA/CCA disease (11.7%). Patients with nasopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma had more cerebrovascular symptoms, and more frequent CCA stenosis. Significant ICA/CCA stenosis was associated with age, smoking, coronary heart disease, stroke, no head and neck surgery, time interval from radiotherapy, and the site of primary tumor. On logistic regression analysis age (>60 years), cerebrovascular symptoms, interval from irradiation (>5 years), and nasopharynx and larynx cancer were found to be independent significant (P <0.05) predictors of 70% or greater ICA/CCA stenosis. Conclusions: Patients who had received radiotherapy to the head and neck have a high risk of developing significant carotid stenosis. Routine duplex ultrasound screening in these patients is indicated.  MP: Objective  To determine the prevalence and risk factors for radiation-induced carotid stenosis in patients with malignant neoplasms of the head and neck.  Design  Prospective cross-sectional screening of extracranial carotid stenosis by color-flow duplex ultrasonography with an analysis of demographic and comorbid risk factors.  Setting  Tertiary oncology and vascular referral center.  Patients  The study included 96 consecutive patients (75 men and 21 women; mean age, 53.6 years) who had undergone cervical radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma more than 12 months ago. The mean post-RT interval was 79.9 months. Fourteen patients had cerebrovascular symptoms. A group of 96 healthy individuals were used as controls.  Main Outcome Measures  Internal carotid stenosis and common carotid artery stenosis were classified by duplex ultrasonography into moderate (30%-69%), severe (70%-99%), and totally occlusive.  Results  Internal carotid artery stenosis of 70% or more was detected in 14 arteries in 12 patients (6 occlusions). Common carotid artery stenosis of 70% or more was found in 11 arteries in 9 patients (4 occlusions). Overall, 15 patients (16%) had critical stenosis in their common or internal carotid arteries, and another 20 (21%) had stenosis in the moderate range. Critical carotid stenosis was not present in any of the control subjects. Severe post-RT carotid stenosis was associated with age (P=.003), smoking (P=.004), heart disease (P<.001), no prior oncological surgery (P<.001), cerebrovascular symptoms (P<.001), and interval from RT (P<.001). Smoking, interval from RT, cerebrovascular symptoms, and no head and neck surgery were significant independent predictors for severe carotid stenosis on multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Conclusions  Patients who undergo irradiation of the head and neck for more than 5 years have a higher risk of developing significant carotid stenosis (relative risk, 15), and routine duplex ultrasound screening is recommended.  MP: Although it is established that small and medium sized arteries undergo extensive radiation damage, the effect on large vessels such as the carotid arteries is less well understood. We sought to determine if an increased severity of carotid artery stenosis is present in patients who have undergone radiotherapy for head and neck tumours. 45 patients aged 43-90 years (average 67) with head and neck malignancies treated with radiotherapy underwent colour Doppler ultrasonographic scanning of the carotid arteries. These patients were compared with a population of asymptomatic historical controls. 60% of patients demonstrated stenosis ranging from 21 to 86%. 38% of patients demonstrated a stenosis greater than or equal to 50%. Carotid artery stenosis appears to be increased in patients who have previously undergone treatment with radiotherapy to the head and neck regions compared with controls (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that radiation has an adverse effect on large vessels. Colour Doppler follow-up may be indicated for patients receiving head and neck radiation therapy.  MP: Background Vascular abnormalities are the predominant histologic changes associated with radiation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study examined if the duration after radiotherapy correlates with the progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and investigated its relationship with inflammatory markers.  Methods One hundred and five NPC patients post-radiotherapy for more than one year and 25 healthy control subjects were examined by B-mode ultrasound for IMT measurement at the far wall of the common carotid artery (CCA). Surrogate markers including lipid profile, HbA1c, and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were assessed.  Results The IMT of CCA was significantly increased in NPC patients and carotid plaque was detected in 38 NPC patients (38/105, 36.2%). Significant risk factors for carotid plaques included age, duration after radiotherapy, and HbA1c levels. Age, duration after radiotherapy, hs-CRP, HbA1c, and platelet count positively correlated with IMT. The cut-off value of age and duration after radiotherapy for the presence of plaque was 52.5 years and 42.5 months, respectively. In NPC subjects, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age, gender, duration after radiotherapy and platelet counts were independently associated with CCA IMT. After adjustments for age, gender and platelet counts, IMT increased in a linear manner with duration after radiotherapy.  Conclusions Radiation-induced vasculopathy is a dynamic and progressive process due to late radiation effects. Extra-cranial color-coded duplex sonography can be part of routine follow-up in NPC patients aged ≥50 years at 40 months post-radiotherapy.  MP: BACKGROUND. Radiation-induced carotid stenosis in patients with head and neck tumors can cause significant mortality and morbidity. This study examined the incidence of stenosis in the extracranial carotid arteries of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. METHODS. The extracranial carotid arteries of 71 (53 male and 18 female; mean age of 53.6 years) postradiation patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were examined with color Doppler ultrasound. The distribution of the arterial stenosis and the degree of stenosis were documented. The results were compared with the control group, which comprised 51 newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (35 male and 16 female, mean age of 48.8 years) before radiotherapy. Incidences of risk factors for arterial stenosis such as hypertension, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia also were studied in these two groups. RESULTS. There was no significant difference in the incidence of risk factors between the two groups. Arterial stenosis was, however, more common in the postradiation group than the preradiation group (56 of 71 vs. 11 of 51). The common/internal carotid arteries (CCA/ICA) were most commonly involved (55 of 71 vs. 11 of 51; P < 0.01), followed by the external carotid artery (ECA) (32 of 71 vs. 1 of 51; P < 0.01) and vertebral artery (VA; 5 of 71 vs. 0; P = 0.069). Significant stenosis (> 50% reduction of luminal diameter) was only found in the postradiation group (21 of 71 in CCA/ICA, 11 of 71 in ECA, 4 of 71 in VA). CONCLUSIONS. This study showed that radiation could cause significant carotid stenosis. Ultrasound examinations for these patients therefore are necessary for early detection and possible intervention of this late radiation-induced complication.   MP: Background and Purpose: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Methods: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit. Results: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/ 71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group. Conclusions: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.  MP: Objectives: To determine the prevalence of radiation-induced carotid stenosis, in patients who were treated for head and neck malignancies, using colour-flow duplex scanning.  Design: Prospective controlled study at a single medical centre.  Participants: We enrolled two groups of patients. The first (radiotherapy group) consisted of patients who received surgical treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy of the neck. The control group consisted of patients with head and neck malignancies who received only surgical treatment.  Main outcome measures: All patients were evaluated with carotid artery ecoDoppler imaging 1 week before and 36 months after the surgical procedure. Intima-media thickness was measured bilaterally at the internal carotid artery and at the bifurcation. Carotid obstruction was classified as low (0–30%), moderate (31–49%) or severe (≥50%).  Results: The preoperative stenosis grade did not differ between groups. In 15/25 patients (60%) in the radiotherapy group, mild stenosis evolved to moderate stenosis, while only 6/37 (16%) of the controls did (P = 0.004). Additionally, 9/39 (23%) patients in the radiotherapy group progressed to severe stenosis compared with only 3/54 (6%) controls (P = 0.029). The overall evolution showed that stenosis worsened in 24/32 (62%) patients in the radiotherapy group and 9/54 (17%) patients in the control groups (P < 0.0001).  Conclusions: These results highlight the need to study the long-term incidence of cerebrovascular events in these two different populations (radiation treated and surgically treated) to identify increased cerebrovascular morbidity.  MP: Objective: Irradiation induced extracranial carotid occlusive disease has been recognized as a potential cause of post-irradiation stroke in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Our study aims to investigate the prevalence of extracranial CA disease in post-irradiated Taiwanese NPC ischemic stroke patients. Methods: Forty-threeNPCpatients with ischemic stroke were retrospectively selected from the stroke registration of the study hospital and compared with 276 first-ever ischemic stroke patients from the same database, of which 31 patients underwent carotid duplex sonography (CDS). Significant atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries were defined as a >50% stenosis or an occlusion according to CDS. Results: Significant carotid lesions occurred in 13 of 31 (42%) NPC patients. Stroke was more frequently caused by large artery disease (44% versus 23%; p < 0.01) in NPC patients than in first-ever stroke patients without NPC. Carotid artery disease (odds ratio 7.22, 95% confidence interval 2.51-20.77; p < 0.0001) and absence of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.93; p = 0.039) were the strongest independent discriminators between NPC stroke patients and non-NPC stroke patients in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Patients who received neck irradiation are at risk for the delayed development of diffused atherosclerosis but also for carotid occlusion within years, although the mechanism remains elusive and probably multifactorial.  MP: Radiotherapy (RT) serves as the most efficient treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and can cause carotid stenosis. This work compared the incidence of significant carotid stenosis between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy (2D-RT) for NPC and explored the risk factors. We retrospectively reviewed 233 cases with NPC who underwent carotid ultrasound post IMRT or 2D-RT from 2006 to 2015. The incidence of significant stenosis after RT was 19.3%. Significant stenosis was identified in 20 (14.6%) of 137 patients treated with IMRT and 25 (26.0%) of 96 patients with 2D-RT, respectively (p = 0.035). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated age (odds ratio = 1.054, 95% CI = 1.011–1.099, p = 0.014), radiation technique (IMRT) (odds ratio = 0.471, 95%CI = 0.241–0.919, p = 0.027) and time interval (odds ratio = 1.068, 95%CI = 1.033–1.105, p = 0.001) as independent predictors for significant carotid stenosis. Our study suggests that IMRT was associated with decreased incidence of significant carotid stenosis versus 2D-RT for NPC. Prevention and carotid ultrasound should be considered for older NPC survivors with longer interval from RT, especially those treated with 2D-RT.  MP: Purpose To investigate radiation-induced carotid and cerebral vascular injury and its relationship with radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.  Methods and Materials Fifty eight NPC patients with radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis (TLN) were recruited in the study. Duplex ultrasonography was used to scan bilateral carotid arterials to evaluate the intima-media thickness (IMT) and occurrence of plaque formation. Flow velocities of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs), internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and basal artery (BA) were estimated through Transcranial Color Doppler (TCD). The results were compared with data from 33 patients who were free from radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis after radiotherapy and 29 healthy individuals.  Results Significant differences in IMT, occurrence of plaques of ICAs and flow velocities of both MCAs and ICAs were found between patients after radiotherapy and healthy individuals (p<0.05). IMT had positive correlation with post radiation interval (p = 0.049). Compared with results from patients without radiation-induced TLN, the mean IMT was significantly thicker in patients with TLN (p<0.001). Plaques were more common in patients with TLN than patients without TLN (p = 0.038). In addition, flow velocities of MCAs and ICAs in patients with TLN were much faster (p<0.001, p<0.001). Among patients with unilateral TLN, flow velocity of MCAs was significantly different between ipsilateral and contralateral sides to the lesion (p = 0.001).  Conclusion Thickening of IMT, occurrence of plaque formation and hemodynamic abnormality are more common in patients after radiotherapy, especially in those with TLN, compared with healthy individuals.  MP: Objective: Carotid duplex ultrasound has revealed that radiotherapy is associated with stenosis of the extracranial carotid arteries in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis and radiation therapy using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in patients with NPC and a history of symptomatic cerebral ischaemia.  Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study conducted in Pok Oi Hospital, Hong Kong. All consecutive CTA scans of the head and neck from January 2008 to December 2009 in patients with a history of transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke were included. Intracranial arterial (including intracranial internal carotid artery, M1 segment of middle cerebral artery, and intracranial vertebral artery) and extracranial arterial stenosis was defined as a diameter reduction of ≥50%. Patient demographics, history of radiotherapy for NPC, smoking history, medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia were recorded.  Results: A total of 152 patients (105 men and 47 women; mean [standard deviation] age, 64.9 [11.6] years) were enroled. Of them, 19 (12.5%) had a history of NPC and treatment by radiotherapy; 133 (87.5%) patients did not receive any head and neck radiotherapy. A statistically significantly increased risk of common carotid artery stenosis (p < 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 34.510) and extracranial arterial stenosis (p = 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 6.607) was observed in patients with NPC treated with radiotherapy compared with those without irradiation. Radiotherapy did not increase the risk of intracranial arterial stenosis (10/19 [52.6%] vs. 75/133 [56.4%]; p = 0.710).  Conclusion: Radiotherapy for NPC is associated with an increased risk for stenosis of the extracranial arteries, particularly the common carotid artery. Radiotherapy for NPC was not shown to increase the risk of intracranial artery stenosis based on CTA findings in patients with symptomatic cerebral ischaemia.  MP: "
"Objective COVID-19 is a novel, severely contagious disease with enormous negative impact on humanity as well as the world economy. An expeditious, feasible tool for detecting COVID-19 remains yet elusive. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying machine learning techniques to predict COVID-19 using non-image data. We have therefore undertaken a meta-analysis to quantify the diagnostic performance of machine learning models facilitating the prediction of COVID-19.  Materials and methods A comprehensive electronic database search for the period between January 1st, 2021 and December 3rd, 2021 was undertaken in order to identify eligible studies relevant to this meta-analysis. Summary sensitivity, specificity, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess potential diagnostic accuracy. Risk of bias was assessed by means of a revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies.  Results A total of 30 studies, including 34 models, met all of the inclusion criteria. Summary sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.86, 0.86, and 0.91, respectively. The purpose of machine learning models, class imbalance, and feature selection are significant covariates useful in explaining the between-study heterogeneity, in terms of both sensitivity and specificity.  Conclusions Our study findings show that non-image data can be used to predict COVID-19 with an acceptable performance. Further, class imbalance and feature selection are suggested to be incorporated whenever building models for the prediction of COVID-19, thus improving further diagnostic performance.","MP: Background: Conventional diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (hereafter, PCR) is associated with prolonged time to diagnosis and significant costs to run the test. The SARS-CoV-2 virus might lead to characteristic patterns in the results of widely available, routine blood tests that could be identified with machine learning methodologies. Machine learning modalities integrating findings from these common laboratory test results might accelerate ruling out COVID-19 in emergency department patients.  Objective: We sought to develop (ie, train and internally validate with cross-validation techniques) and externally validate a machine learning model to rule out COVID 19 using only routine blood tests among adults in emergency departments.  Methods: Using clinical data from emergency departments (EDs) from 66 US hospitals before the pandemic (before the end of December 2019) or during the pandemic (March-July 2020), we included patients aged ≥20 years in the study time frame. We excluded those with missing laboratory results. Model training used 2183 PCR-confirmed cases from 43 hospitals during the pandemic; negative controls were 10,000 prepandemic patients from the same hospitals. External validation used 23 hospitals with 1020 PCR-confirmed cases and 171,734 prepandemic negative controls. The main outcome was COVID 19 status predicted using same-day routine laboratory results. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve as well as sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV).  Results: Of 192,779 patients included in the training, external validation, and sensitivity data sets (median age decile 50 [IQR 30-60] years, 40.5% male [78,249/192,779]), AUROC for training and external validation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92). Using a risk score cutoff of 1.0 (out of 100) in the external validation data set, the model achieved sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 41.7%; with a cutoff of 2.0, sensitivity was 92.6% and specificity was 59.9%. At the cutoff of 2.0, the NPVs at a prevalence of 1%, 10%, and 20% were 99.9%, 98.6%, and 97%, respectively.  Conclusions: A machine learning model developed with multicenter clinical data integrating commonly collected ED laboratory data demonstrated high rule-out accuracy for COVID-19 status, and might inform selective use of PCR-based testing.  MP: Background: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency and the case fatality rate in the United Kingdom is significant. Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.  Objective: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN).  Methods: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2.  Results: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%.  Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems.  MP: Worldwide, testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited and bottlenecks in the scale up of polymerase chain reaction (PCR-based testing exist. Our aim was to develop and evaluate a machine learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 in the inpatient setting. The algorithm was based on basic demographic and laboratory features to serve as a screening tool at hospitals where testing is scarce or unavailable. We used retrospectively collected data from the UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, California. We included all emergency room or inpatient cases receiving SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing who also had a set of ancillary laboratory features (n = 1,455) between 1 March 2020 and 24 May 2020. We tested seven machine learning models and used a combination of those models for the final diagnostic classification. In the test set (n = 392), our combined model had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87–0.96). The model achieved a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85–0.98), specificity of 0.64 (95% CI 0.58–0.69). We found that our machine learning algorithm had excellent diagnostic metrics compared to SARS-CoV-2 PCR. This ensemble machine learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 has the potential to be used as a screening tool in hospital settings where PCR testing is scarce or unavailable.  MP: This paper analyzes a sample of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the region of Madrid (Spain). Survival analysis, logistic regression, and machine learning techniques (both supervised and unsupervised) are applied to carry out the analysis where the endpoint variable is the reason for hospital discharge (home or deceased). The different methods applied show the importance of variables such as age, O2 saturation at Emergency Rooms (ER), and whether the patient comes from a nursing home. In addition, biclustering is used to globally analyze the patient-drug dataset, extracting segments of patients. We highlight the validity of the classifiers developed to predict the mortality, reaching an appreciable accuracy. Finally, interpretable decision rules for estimating the risk of mortality of patients can be obtained from the decision tree, which can be crucial in the prioritization of medical care and resources.  MP: Background The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people across the globe. It is associated with a high mortality rate and has created a global crisis by straining medical resources worldwide.  Objectives To develop and validate machine-learning models for prediction of mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients presenting to emergency room and for prediction of in-hospital mortality once a patient is admitted.  Methods Two cohorts were used for the two different aims. 1980 COVID-19 patients were enrolled for the aim of prediction ofMV. 1036 patients’ data, including demographics, past smoking and drinking history, past medical history and vital signs at emergency room (ER), laboratory values, and treatments were collected for training and 674 patients were enrolled for validation using XGBoost algorithm. For the second aim to predict in-hospital mortality, 3491 hospitalized patients via ER were enrolled. CatBoost, a new gradient-boosting algorithm was applied for training and validation of the cohort.  Results Older age, higher temperature, increased respiratory rate (RR) and a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) from the first set of vital signs were associated with an increased risk of MV amongst the 1980 patients in the ER. The model had a high accuracy of 86.2% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87.8%. While, patients who required MV, had a higher RR, Body mass index (BMI) and longer length of stay in the hospital were the major features associated with in-hospital mortality. The second model had a high accuracy of 80% with NPV of 81.6%.  Conclusion Machine learning models using XGBoost and catBoost algorithms can predict need for mechanical ventilation and mortality with a very high accuracy in COVID-19 patients.  MP: The COVID-19 outbreak has spread extensively around the world. Loss of smell and taste have emerged as main predictors for COVID-19. The objective of our study is to develop a comprehensive machine learning (ML) modelling framework to assess the predictive value of smell and taste disorders, along with other symptoms, in COVID-19 infection. A multicenter case-control study was performed, in which suspected cases for COVID-19, who were tested by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), informed about the presence and severity of their symptoms using visual analog scales (VAS). ML algorithms were applied to the collected data to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis using a 50-fold cross-validation scheme by randomly splitting the patients in training (75%) and testing datasets (25%). A total of 777 patients were included. Loss of smell and taste were found to be the symptoms with higher odds ratios of 6.21 and 2.42 for COVID-19 positivity. The ML algorithms applied reached an average accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 78% when using VAS to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis. This study concludes that smell and taste disorders are accurate predictors, with ML algorithms constituting helpful tools for COVID-19 diagnostic prediction.  MP: Background: During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model.  Objective: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients’ chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model.  Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients’ data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables.  Results: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791).  Conclusions: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning–based clinical decision support tools.  MP: Objectives To appraise effective predictors for COVID-19 mortality in a retrospective cohort study.  Methods A total of 1270 COVID-19 patients, including 984 admitted in Sino French New City Branch (training and internal validation sets randomly split at 7:3 ratio) and 286 admitted in Optical Valley Branch (external validation set) of Wuhan Tongji hospital, were included in this study. Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores.  Results Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets.  Conclusion We proposed the disease severity, age, serum levels of hs-CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-10 as significant predictors for death risk of COVID-19, which may help to identify the high-risk COVID-19 cases.  MP: Objectives: Approximately 20–30% of patients with COVID-19 require hospitalization, and 5–12% may require critical care in an intensive care unit (ICU). A rapid surge in cases of severe COVID-19 will lead to a corresponding surge in demand for ICU care. Because of constraints on resources, frontline healthcare workers may be unable to provide the frequent monitoring and assessment required for all patients at high risk of clinical deterioration. We developed a machine learning-based risk prioritization tool that predicts ICU transfer within 24 h, seeking to facilitate efficient use of care providers’ efforts and help hospitals plan their flow of operations. Methods: A retrospective cohort was comprised of non-ICU COVID-19 admissions at a large acute care health system between 26 February and 18 April 2020. Time series data, including vital signs, nursing assessments, laboratory data, and electrocardiograms, were used as input variables for training a random forest (RF) model. The cohort was randomly split (70:30) into training and test sets. The RF model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set, and its predictive performance on the test set was then evaluated. Results: The cohort consisted of 1987 unique patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to non-ICU units of the hospital. The median time to ICU transfer was 2.45 days from the time of admission. Compared to actual admissions, the tool had 72.8% (95% CI: 63.2–81.1%) sensitivity, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.7–77.9%) specificity, 76.2% (95% CI: 74.6–77.7%) accuracy, and 79.9% (95% CI: 75.2–84.6%) area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Conclusions: A ML-based prediction model can be used as a screening tool to identify patients at risk of imminent ICU transfer within 24 h. This tool could improve the management of hospital resources and patient-throughput planning, thus delivering more effective care to patients hospitalized with COVID-19.  MP: Background COVID-19 pandemics has challenged emergency response systems worldwide, with widespread reports of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care structure. A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.  Purpose This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results.  Methods Hemogram exams data from 510 symptomatic patients (73 positives and 437 negatives) were used to model and predict qRT-PCR results through Naïve-Bayes algorithms. Different scarcity scenarios were simulated, including symptomatic essential workforce management and absence of diagnostic tests. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context.  Results Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, yielding a 100% sensitivity and 22.6% specificity with a prior of 0.9999; 76.7% for both sensitivity and specificity with a prior of 0.2933; and 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a prior of 0.001. Regarding background scarcity context, resources allocation can be significantly improved when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice.  Conclusions Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.  MP: Background: Prioritizing patients in need of intensive care is necessary to reduce the mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that are not always easily available.  Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristics—baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms.  Methods: A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results: A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group. Both the AUCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0.836 (95% CI 0.825-0.847) and 0.843 (95% CI 0.829-0.857), respectively.  Conclusions: We developed a machine learning model comprising simple patient-provided characteristics, which can efficiently predict the need for intensive care among patients with COVID-19.  MP:"
"Objective to conduct a systematic review with consequent meta-analysis evaluating the best treatment for Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) 31A1-A3 trochanteric fractures when comparing the sliding hip screw (SHS) to the intramedullary nail (IMN). The outcomes used for comparison are major complications (in total, as well as nonunion and infection specifically), mortality rates, functional outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM).  Materials and methods Search strings for the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Medline and Embase databases were developed with the help of a scientific librarian. Two authors screened the studies from the search string independently using Covidence.org and data extraction was performed similarly. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised trials (ROB2) for RCT studies, and Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for non-RCT studies. Meta-analyses were performed using Log Risk Ratio as the primary effect estimate.  Results Of the 2,051 studies screened by the two authors, six RCTs and six non-RCTs were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 10,402 patients. The results indicated no significant differences in total major complications, nonunion, infection or mortality between SHS and IMN treatments for AO/OTA 31A1, 31A2 and 31A3 trochanteric fractures. Due to a lack of compatible data, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis on function scores and PROM. However, there are trends that favour IMN for 31A1 and 31A2 fractures.  Conclusion No significant difference between SHS and IMN was found in the meta-analysis in any of the examined AO/OTA fracture subtypes in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. When assessing function scores and PROM, we found trends favouring IMN for 31A1 and 31A2 fractures that should be explored further.","MP: Purpose The purpose of this prospective randomised trial was to assess whether an intramedullary nail is superior to a sliding hip screw in the treatment of multifragmentary intertrochanteric fractures  Methods Eighty patients with a 31-A2.2 or A2.3 Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) intertrochanteric fracture were randomly allocated to fixation with either the Gamma nail or the AMBI sliding hip screw device.  Results All patients were followed up at one, three, six and 12 months postoperatively, except for nine who died. There was no statistical difference in Parker mobility score between groups. The Gamma nail group had significantly higher Barthel Index and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores than the AMBI group at 12 months. At the same time, the EQ-5D score had returned to its pre-operative values in the Gamma nail group but not in the AMBI group. There were no differences in mortality, radiation time and hospital stay. Duration of the operation, incision length and hip pain occurrence were significantly less in the Gamma nail group.  Conclusions Few failures occur when unstable 31-A2.2 and A2.3 AO/OTA fractures are fixed with a sliding hip screw. Nevertheless, an intramedullary nail seems superior in reconstituting patients to their pre-operative state.  MP: Aims: To determine the optimum choice of implant for a patient with a the different types of trochanteric hip fracture. Patients and methods: 1000 patients with a trochanteric hip fracture were randomised to internal fixation of the fracture with either a Sliding Hip Screw or an intramedullary nail. Fractures were subdivided into two part fractures, comminuted fractures and fractures at the level of the lesser trochanter (reversed/oblique and transverse). Functional assessment for up to one year from injury was undertaken by a research nurse blinded to the treatment allocation. Results: The mean age of patients was 82 years and 77% were female. There was a significantly improved regain of mobility for those treated with the intramedullary nail. No statistically significant differences between the two types of fixation methods was observed for mortality, fracture healing complications, re-operations, hospital stay, length of surgery, blood transfusion requirements, medical complications, degree of residual pain or regain of independence. These finding were valid for all fracture types. Conclusion: This study is the first adequately powered randomised trial on this topic and demonstrates that there are no notable differences in either process or functional outcomes between these two treatment methods, other than a tendency to better regain of mobility for those fractures fixed with an intramedullary nail.  MP: Introduction Comparison was made of the clinical and radiological results of the surgical treatments of proximal femoral nail (PFN), dynamic hip screw (DHS) or proximal femoral locking compression plate (PF-LCP) in patients with AO 31A2.2/2.3 unstable intertrochanteric femoral fracture(ITF).  Methods Evaluation was made of a total of 91 patients in respect of age, gender, time from fracture to surgery, operating time, amount of blood replacement, total hospitalisation, follow-up period, time to full weight-bearing, time to union, complications and Harris hip scores(HHS).  Results A statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of perioperative operating time, blood replacement and hospitalisation period with the values of the PFN group seen to be superior to those of the other two groups (p < 0.001). No significant difference was determined beween the DHS and PFN groups in respect of time to union and in the long-term HHS, both groups were seen to be superior to the PF-LCP group (p < 0.001). Full weight-bearing was statistically significantly earlier in the PFN group (p < 0.001). The numbers of implant failures was statistically significantly higher in the PF-LCP group (p < 0.001).  Conclusion The new generation intra-medullar nails are easy to apply and have more successful clinical results compared to extra-medullar implants in the treatment of A2 unstable ITF. Due to the high rates of implant failure, PF-LCP should not be preferred in these fractures.  MP: Background:  Controversy exists with regard to whether to treat AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur with an intramedullary device or an extramedullary device. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed to compare the outcome of treatment of these unstable fractures of the proximal part of the femur with either a sliding hip screw or a long gamma nail.  Methods:  Two hundred and ten patients presenting with an AO/OTA 31-A2 fracture of the proximal part of the femur were randomized, at the time of admission, to fixation with use of either a long gamma nail or a sliding hip screw. The primary outcome measure was reoperation within the first postoperative year. Secondary measures included mortality, length of hospital stay, transfusion rate, change in mobility and residence, and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol 5D outcome score.  Results:  There was no significant difference between the reoperation rates for the two groups. In total, five patients (three from the long-gamma-nail group and two from the sliding-hip-screw group) underwent revision surgery because of cut-out. Tip-apex distance was found to correlate with the implant cut-out rate. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the EuroQol 5D outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures.  Conclusions:  When compared with the long gamma nail, the sliding hip screw should remain the gold standard for the treatment of AO/OTA 31-A2 fractures of the proximal part of the femur because it is associated with similar outcomes with less expense.  MP: Neck of femur fractures are the most prevalent type of injury in elderly trauma patients. Both intra and extra capsular type of fractures are equally distributed in the given population. Traditionally, Extra capsular fractures are fixed with Dynamic Hip screw or Intra medullary nailing based on the type of fracture. NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) recommends fixing 31-A1 and 31-A2 fractures with DHS (Dynamic Hip Screw) whereas AO recommends fixing 31-A1 with DHS and 31-A2.1 subtype with DHS and 31-A2.2 and 31-A2.3with IMN (Intra medullary nail). In regional trauma centre 178 patients, 125 females and 53 males with extra capsular neck of femur fractures fixed were selected in a retrospective study. The data was spanning over a period of 1 year. Fractures were classified as per AO classification by two registrars. The implant selection was analysed in terms of the short term out come to find out the cost effectiveness of one over the other. The quality of reduction was assessed as per standard criteria and consideration of lateral femoral wall thickness was taken into account to assess the stability of fracture. The study found more risk of peri prosthetic fractures associated with Intra medullary nailing as compared to Dynamic Hip screw and more risk of Varus collapse was found to be associated with DHS as compared to IM Nail. Moreover, despite of Nail being costly as compared to DHS, the study did not reveal its superiority in terms of inpatient hospital stay. In appropriately selected patient DHS provides results in terms of hospital stay, revision rate and wound complications comparable to IM Nail in the short term justifying its use in the above-mentioned fracture patterns as per the standard National Institute of clinical Excellence guidelines.  MP: Background  Sliding hip screws (SHSs) and intramedullary (IM) nails are well-documented implants for simple two-part intertrochanteric fractures; however, there is no consensus regarding which type of implant is better.  Questions/purposes  We asked whether patients with simple two-part intertrochanteric fractures treated with IM nailing had (1) a lower reoperation rate and (2) less pain and better quality of life than patients treated with SHSs.  Methods  We used data from the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register on 7643 operations for simple two-part intertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA Type A1) treated with an SHS (n = 6355) or an IM nail (n = 1288) between 2005 and 2010. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess reoperation percentages and a Cox regression model was used to assess the risk of reoperation. Questionnaires regarding pain and quality of life were answered by the patients at 4, 12, and 36 months postoperatively.  Results  We found an increased risk of reoperation after IM nailing within 1 postoperative year: 2.4% and 4.2% for SHS and IM nails, respectively. The difference persisted with time: 4.5% and 7.1% at 3 years. We also found minor differences for pain and quality of life which we judged clinically unimportant.  Conclusions  Based on our findings and a critical review of the literature, we suggest an SHS is likely the preferred implant for simple two-part intertrochanteric fractures.  MP: With an annual incidence greater than 65,000 in the United Kingdom, hip fractures are a common but debilitating injury predominantly affecting those over 65. Treatment is based on the anatomical location of the fracture relative to the capsule of the hip joint - fractures occurring within it are treated by arthroplasty, while extracapsular fractures are an indication for fixation. Intertrochanteric fractures are further grouped as stable (AO/OTA 31A1/A2) or unstable (31A3) which in turn governs in the current UK guidelines whether this fixation is achieved with a dynamic hip screw or intramedullary device. Anecdotally, some units are tending towards intramedullary devices for 31A2 fractures as well, a practice which from the evidence does not appear to confer benefit and carries an excess cost. We reviewed our data submitted to the National Hip Fracture Database over the last five years and identified all intertrochanteric fractures, from which cohort we identified all patients with 31A2 fractures by review of radiographs. The cohort comprised 370 patients. We then recorded age, gender, ASA grade, abbreviated mental test score, residence from where admitted, length of stay, destination on discharge and whether any further operations were required. There was no significant difference in the demographics of the groups, year-on-year, except gender mix. There was a significant, twenty-fold rise in the use of intramedullary devices between 2011 and 2015. Length of stay, length of overall episode of care, revision rates, mortality and destination on discharge were unchanged. This use is not supported by NICE guidelines and this study offers no evidence to contradict this position. We advocate all centres examine their practice to avoid a costly intervention without clinical benefit.  MP: Background: The use of intramedullary devices for the management of intertrochanteric fractures has steadily increased without good evidence of their clinical efficacy. This prospective randomized multicenter study was designed to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients who had been treated with a traditional extramedullary hip screw for an unstable (AO/OTA 31-A2) intertrochanteric hip fracture with those of patients who had been treated with the newer intramedullary device for the same injury. Methods: The Lower Extremity Measure (LEM) was used as the primary hip-specific outcome tool. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the timed ""Up &Go"" (TUG) test, as well as a timed two-minute walk test were used as secondary clinical outcome tools. Specific radiographic parameters were collected to assess for fracture movement, heterotopic ossi-fication, and implant failure. Results: No significant differences were noted between the intramedullary and extramedullary treatment arms with regard to either the primary or the secondary clinical outcome tools. The radiographic parameters favored the intramedullary treatment arm, which had less femoral neck shortening. Conclusions: While the use of the intramedullary devices led to better radiographic outcomes in this study, this did not translate to improved functional outcomes.  MP: Background Dynamic hip screws (DHSs) and proximal femoral nails anti-rotation (PFNAs) are well-documented implants for stable intertrochanteric femur fractures(IFFs); however, there is no consensus regarding which type of implant is the better option for stable IFFs. This study aimed to compare DHSs with PFNAs in the management of stable intertrochanteric fractures.  Methods A retrospective study was performed in our institution. Between June, 2005 and November, 2015, 267 patients (267 hips) with stable IFFs (AO/OTA Type 3.1A1) were treated with a DHS or a PFNA. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to focus on isolated stable IFFs in ambulatory patients. Follow-up was undertaken at 1, 3, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48 postoperative months, and at final follow-up. Radiograph outcomes were obtained at all visits. The primary outcome measure was re-operation rate. The secondary outcome was patient function, evaluated using Harris hip score (HHS). Tertiary outcomes included: intra- and post-operative orthopaedic complications.  Results Two hundred twenty two patients (110 in the PFNA group and 112 in the DHS group) were evaluated with a mean follow-up period of 53 months (range, 48–60 months). There was an increased risk of reoperation after DHS in one-year follow-up: 0 % and 5.4 % for PFNA and DHS, respectively (P = 0.029). The difference persisted with time: 6.4 % and 13.4 % at last follow-up (P < 0.05). There are statistical differences in postoperative HHS at 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48 months postoperatively and at final follow-up. No statistical differences in medical complications was observed between the two groups. The orthopaedic complications were more in the DHS group (n = 42) compared with the PFNA group (n = 18) (P <0.05).  Conclusion Compared with PFNA device, DHS device might not be the preferred implant for stable intertrochanteric femur fractures.  MP: This prospective randomized study compared the outcome of elderly patients with an unstable pertrochanteric fracture, treated with a proximal femoral nail antirotation device (PFNA; n = 51) or a dynamic hip screw (DHS; n = 55). All patients in the DHS group and nine in the PFNA group had open reductions. Incisions were significantly shorter for the PFNA than the DHS group. Blood loss and the number of patients requiring postoperative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group. Time to mobilization with a frame was significantly shorter in the PFNA group, and post-operative complications were more common in the DHS group. Poor fracture reduction led to three revisions. All fractures in both groups united during follow-up. The PFNA allowed earlier mobilization and faster recovery than the DHS. The PFNA is a highly acceptable, minimally invasive implant for unstable fractures.  MP: Aim We sought to determine whether intramedullary fixation with proximal femoral nail antirotation produces comparable outcomes to dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures.  Materials and methods Patients were randomly allocated to receive proximal femoral nail antirotation (Group 1, n = 96, mean age; 77.22 ± 6.82 years) or dynamic hip screw (Group 2, n = 102, mean age; 76.86 ± 6.74 years). Outcome measures were time of operation and fluoroscopy, amount of blood loss and occurrence of surgery-related complications. Tip–apex distance and femoral neck shortening were also evaluated. Patients were evaluated at the sixth month to assess the recovery of walking ability. Survival information was obtained from a civil registry.  Results Operative and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter and blood loss was significantly lower in Group 1 than those in Group 2. Complication rates, mean tip–apex indices and recovery of walking ability were similar between groups, whereas independent walking was more common in Group 1 than in Group 2. Until the sixth month, screw cutout occurred in eight (7.8 %) and seven (7.3 %) patients in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (p = 0.88). Three-year survival rate was 61.6 ± 9.4 vs 57.3 ± 9.7 % in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (p = 0.50).  Conclusion Proximal femoral nail antirotation technique offers better recovery than dynamic hip screw, whereas both techniques possess the same risk of postoperative complications.  MP: Objective To evaluate long-term radiographic and functional outcomes between dynamic hip screw (DHS) and proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) fixation for treatment of osteoporotic type 31-A1 intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFFs) among elderly patients Methods A retrospective comparative study was carried out. Follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively and yearly thereafter. The primary outcome was the radiographic outcome, and the secondary outcome was the functional outcome. Results A significant difference in radiographic complications was observed between the DHS group (n = 45, 40.2%) and PFNA group (n = 15, 13.6%). The risk of femoral shaft fracture after implant removal at the 1-year follow-up was increased by 0.9% (n = 1) and 6.3% (n = 7) in the PFNA and DHS groups, respectively. This difference persisted with rates of 3.6% (n = 4) and 12.5% (n = 14) at the final follow-up. Additionally, significant differences were present in the Harris hip score at each visit. Conclusion Our results indicate that PFNA yields better outcomes than DHS fixation among elderly patients with osteoporotic type 31-A1 IFFs."
"Background We evaluated the efficacy and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and ranked the relative efficacy of different stimulation protocols.  Methods We performed a search for randomised, sham-controlled trials of rTMS for OCD. The primary analysis included both a pairwise meta-analysis and a series of frequentist network meta-analyses (NMA) of OCD symptom severity. Secondary analyses were carried out on relevant clinical factors and safety.  Results 21 studies involving 662 patients were included. The pairwise meta-analysis showed that rTMS for OCD is efficacious across all protocols (Hedges’ g=-0.502 [95%CI= -0.708, -0.296]). The first NMA, with stimulation protocols clustered only by anatomical location, showed that both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) stimulation and medial frontal cortex stimulation were efficacious. In the second NMA, considering each unique combination of frequency and location separately, low frequency (LF) pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) stimulation, high frequency (HF) bilateral dlPFC stimulation, and LF right dlPFC stimulation were all efficacious . LF right dlPFC was ranked highest in terms of efficacy, although the corresponding confidence intervals overlapped with the other two protocols.  Limitations Evidence base included mostly small studies, with only a few studies using similar protocols, giving a sparse network. Studies were heterogeneous, and a risk of publication bias was found.  Conclusions rTMS for OCD was efficacious compared with sham stimulation. LF right dlPFC, HF bilateral dlPFC and LF preSMA stimulation were all efficacious protocols with significant and comparable clinical improvements. Future studies should further investigate the relative merits of these three protocols.","MP: Objective  The current study investigated the efficacy of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over bilateral presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) in patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with partial/poor response to pharmacotherapy, in a double-blinded randomized sham controlled trial.  Method  Forty subjects with OCD, who were on stable medications with partial/poor response to pharmacotherapy were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 20 in each group), to receive either active or sham low-frequency rTMS over bilateral pre-SMA. Thirty-six patients were eligible for intent-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference in relevant demographic and clinical variables between the 2 groups at baseline.  Results  There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups after 3 weeks of treatment in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score (time*group interaction, F2.48,84.16 = 0.80, P = 0.40) and other secondary outcome measures including responder rates and depressive and anxiety symptoms.  Conclusions  Low-frequency rTMS over pre-SMA may not be effective as an augmenting agent in partial/poor responders to SRIs. This study underlines the need to explore alternate rTMS protocols in OCD.  MP: Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 1% to 3% of the world population. The primary treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and behavioral therapy. Despite therapy, approximately 30% to 40% of patients continue to suffer from disabling OCD symptoms. Objective: is to evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS) in management of OCD patients, either as monotherapy or as add-on treatment in patients with poor response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Methods: The present study included sixty OCD patients. Forty patients were none medicated; twenty of them (randomly selected), received sham stimulation as a control group and the other twenty received real r-TMS. The third group included twenty patients with poor response to SSRIs; they received real r-TMS. The results of the three groups were compared pre and post treatment. Results: While r-TMS was not effective as a single treatment for OCD patients, it was effective as add-on treatment for OCD patients. The use of r-TMS induced a statistically significant increase in the value of motor threshold (MT) in the active group of patients (both Monotherapy and add-on treatment groups) after receiving 15 sessions of real r-TMS; this means that TMS lowered the hyperexcitable circuits in OCD.  MP: Background Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disorder with poor response to pharmacological treatments. Converging evidences suggest that OCD patients suffer from dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, including in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Objective To examine whether modulation of mPFC-ACC activity by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) affects OCD symptoms. Methods Treatment resistant OCD participants were treated with either high-frequency (HF; 20 Hz), low-frequency (LF; 1 Hz), or sham DTMS of the mPFC and ACC for five weeks, in a double-blinded manner. All treatments were administered following symptoms provocation, and EEG measurements during a Stroop task were acquired to examine changes in error-related activity. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Results Interim analysis revealed that YBOCS scores were significantly improved following HF (n = 7), but not LF stimulation (n = 8), compared to sham (n = 8), and thus recruitment for the LF group was terminated. Following completion of the study, the response rate in the HF group (n = 18) was significantly higher than that of the sham group (n = 15) for at least one month following the end of the treatment. Notably, the clinical response in the HF group correlated with increased Error Related Negativity (ERN) in the Stroop task, an electrophysiological component that is attributed to ACC activity. Conclusion HF DTMS over the mPFC-ACC alleviates OCD symptoms and may be used as a novel therapeutic intervention. Notwithstanding alternative explanations, this may stem from DTMS ability to directly modify ACC activity.  MP: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become widely used as a therapeutic tool in psychiatric research. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different frequencies of rTMS over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in OCD. Forty five patients with OCD participated in the study. Patients were evaluated using: Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S). They were randomly classified into three groups: 1st group received 1 Hz rTMS; 2nd group received 10 Hz rTMS; and 3rd group received sham stimulation all at 100% of the resting motor threshold for 10 sessions. They were followed up after the last treatment session and 3 months later. There was a significant “time”×“group” interaction for 1 Hz versus Sham but not for 10 Hz versus Sham. 1 Hz versus 10 Hz groups showed a significant interaction for Y-BOCS and HAM-A (P=0.001 and 0.0001 respectively). 1 Hz rTMS has a greater clinical benefit than 10 Hz or Sham. There was also a significantly larger percentage change in GCI-S in the 1 Hz group versus either 10 Hz or sham. We conclude that 1 Hz-rTMS, targeting right DLPFC is a promising tool for treatment of OCD.  MP: Recent findings indicate that the motor and premotor cortices are hyperexcitable in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The authors have performed the first randomized, double-blind clinical trial of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in OCD, with a 3-month follow-up. OCD patients (N=22) were assigned to either 2 weeks of active or sham rTMS to the supplementary motor area bilaterally. After 14 weeks, the response rate was 41% (7/12) with active and 10% (1/10) with sham treatment. At 14 weeks, patients receiving active rTMS showed, on average, a 35% reduction on the Y-BOCS, as compared with a 6.2% reduction in those receiving sham treatment.  MP: Objectives: Both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological methods are used in the treatment of patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), and both with encouraging but also mixed results. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) improves symptoms and reduces illness severity in patients suffering from treatment-resistant OCD. Methods: A total of 21 patients (57% females; mean age: M=35.8 years) suffering from treatment-resistant OCD were randomly assigned either to an rTMS-first-sham-second, or a sham-first-rTMS-second condition. Treatment sessions lasted for 4 weeks with five sessions per week, each of about 50min duration. Symptoms were assessed via both self- and expert-ratings. Results: Both self- and expert-reported symptom severity reduced in the rTMS condition as compared to the sham condition. Full- and partial responses were observed in the rTMS-condition, but not in the sham-condition. Conclusions: The pattern of results from this single-blind, sham- and cross-over design suggests that rTMS is a successful intervention for patients suffering from treatment-resistant OCD.  MP: Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a complex disorder with 40 to 60 % of patients resistant to treatment. Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) is a promising new technique that has been shown to induce potent and long lasting effects on cortical excitability. The present study evaluated for the first time therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of continuous TBS (cTBS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in treatment resistant OCD patients using a double blind, sham-controlled design. Methods: Thirty treatment resistant OCD outpatients were randomized to receive either active cTBS or sham cTBS for 6 weeks (5 sessions per week). Each treatment session consisted of 600 stimuli at an intensity of 70% of resting motor threshold. Patients were evaluated at baseline, at the end of treatment (week 6), and follow-up (week 12). Response to treatment was defined as at least 25% decrease on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Results: There was no significant difference between active and sham cTBS groups in treatment efficacy. Responder rates were not different between the two groups at week 6 (cTBS 28% versus sham 36%; p = 0.686) and week 12 (cTBS 28% versus sham 36%; p = 0.686). Depressive and anxious symptoms improvements were similar in the two groups. Conclusion: This study is the first controlled trial using cTBS in treatment resistant OCD patients. The use of cTBS over the SMA is safe but not sufficient to improve OCD symptoms. Further studies are needed to identify the optimal parameters to be used in OCD patients.  MP: Recently, strategies beyond pharmacological and psychological treatments have been developed for the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Specifically, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed as an adjunctive treatment in cases of treatment-refractory OCD. Here, we investigate six weeks of low frequency rTMS, applied bilaterally and simultaneously over the sensory motor area, in OCD patients in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Twenty-two participants were randomly enrolled into the treatment (ACTIVE = 10) or placebo (SHAM = 12) groups. At each of seven visits (baseline; day 1 and weeks 2, 4, and 6 of treatment; and two and six weeks after treatment) the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was administered. At the end of the six weeks of rTMS, patients in the ACTIVE group showed a clinically significant decrease in Y-BOCS scores compared to both the baseline and the SHAM group. This effect was maintained six weeks following the end of rTMS treatment. Therefore, in this sample, rTMS appeared to significantly improve the OCD symptoms of the treated patients beyond the treatment window. More studies need to be conducted to determine the generalizability of these findings and to define the duration of rTMS’ clinical effect on the Y-BOCS.  MP: Objective: There is some evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective method of treating patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, we tested the hypothesis that rTMS has a positive impact both on symptom severity and cognitive performance in such patients. Specifically, short-term verbal processing speed and flexibility were assessed. Method: Ten patients suffering from refractory OCD and treated with standard medication were randomly assigned either to a treatment-first or to a sham-first condition. At baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks, symptom severity (experts' ratings) and cognitive performance (auditory perception, visual perception, short-term memory, and processing speed) were assessed. After 2 weeks, the treatment condition switched to the sham condition, and the sham condition switched to the treatment condition. Results: Under treatment but not under sham conditions, symptom severity reduced. Moreover, cognitive performance improved in parallel. Conclusions: rTMS is a safe and efficient treatment for patients suffering from refractory OCD; symptoms and cognitive performance improved in parallel.  MP: Objective: The present study investigated possible therapeutic effects and safety of sequentially combined low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area in patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. Method: Between February 2007 and January 2008, we carried out a study with a rater-blinded, sham-controlled design in which 20 patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, confirmed by a psychiatrist after use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version, were randomly assigned to either active rTMS (n = 10) or sham treatment (n = 10). Over 10 days, rTMS of 1 Hz was given at 110% of the motor threshold for 20 minutes over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and sequentially at 1 Hz at 100% of the motor threshold for 20 minutes over the supplementary motor area. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score. Results: For the between-group analyses, there were no significant differences over 4 weeks between the active and sham groups on the YBOCS (F = 0.01, P = .92) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; F = 0.39, P = .54). In repeated-measures analyses on all subjects, there was a significant effect of time on the YBOCS (F = 5.48, P = .009) and the MADRS (F = 6.55, P = .004). There were no significant group-by-time interactions for the YBOCS (F = 0.03, P = .94) or the MADRS (F = 0.09, P = .67). Conclusions: These findings suggest that 10 sessions of sequential rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the supplementary motor area at low frequency had no therapeutic effect on obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, rTMS was a safe method of treatment, and there was no significant change in cognitive function after rTMS. Further controlled studies using a more sophisticated sham system in larger samples are required to confirm the effect of rTMS in obsessive-compulsive disorder.  MP: Background  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly prevalent and devastating psychiatric condition. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potential and non-invasive treatment for OCD. Diverse efficacies of rTMS have been reported in different locations or frequencies of the stimulation. The main objective of this study was to assess the treatment effect for OCD with alpha electroencephalogram (αEEG)-guided TMS over dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally.  Methods  There were 25 OCD patients in the αTMS treatment group and 21 OCD patients in the sham control group. Each subject received 10 daily treatment sessions (5 days a week). The αTMS group had significant reduction in scores of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) compared with the control group at the end of 2-week treatment and 1-week follow-up. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to test the effects between the two groups.  Results  Significant difference in scores of obsession and HAMA were found between the two groups after treatment. No significant difference in scores of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was found between the two groups after the treatment, but statistical significance was shown at the end of 1-week follow-up.  Conclusions  αEEG-guided TMS may be an effective treatment for OCD and related anxiety. Delayed response to αTMS in depression suggests that it might be secondary to the improvement of primary response in OCD and anxiety.  MP: Many patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) do not achieve satisfactory symptom improvement with conventional treatments. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. This was a double-blind randomized trial involving 30 treatment-resistant OCD outpatients, allocated to have either sham or active high-frequency rTMS (over the rDLPFC) added to their treatment regimens for 6 wk, with 6 wk of follow-up. Active rTMS consisted of 30 applications (Figure-of-eight coil; 10 Hz at 110% of motor threshold; 1 session/d; 40 trains/session; 5 s/train; 25-s intertrain interval). At weeks 0, 2, 6, 8, and 12, we applied the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-14), 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and 36-item Short-form Health Survey. The primary outcome measure was a positive response (⩾30% improvement in YBOCS score, together with a ‘much improved’ or ‘very much improved’ CGI – Improvement scale rating). One patient in each group showed a positive response (p=1.00). For YBOCS score, there was significant effect of time (F=7.33, p=0.002) but no significant group effect or group×time interaction. In treatment-resistant OCD, active rTMS over the rDLPFC does not appear to be superior to sham rTMS in relieving obsessive–compulsive symptoms, reducing clinical severity, or improving treatment response, although there is evidence of a placebo effect.  MP: In open trials, 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the supplementary motor area (SMA) improved symptoms and normalized cortical hyper-excitability of patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Here we present the results of a randomized sham-controlled double-blind study. Medication-resistant OCD patients (n=21) were assigned 4 wk either active or sham rTMS to the SMA bilaterally. rTMS parameters consisted of 1200 pulses/d, at 1 Hz and 100% of motor threshold (MT). Eighteen patients completed the study. Response to treatment was defined as a ⩾25% decrease on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Non-responders to sham and responders to active or sham rTMS were offered four additional weeks of open active rTMS. After 4 wk, the response rate in the completer sample was 67% (6/9) with active and 22% (2/9) with sham rTMS. At 4 wk, patients receiving active rTMS showed on average a 25% reduction in the YBOCS compared to a 12% reduction in those receiving sham. In those who received 8-wk active rTMS, OCD symptoms improved from 28.2±5.8 to 14.5±3.6. In patients randomized to active rTMS, MT measures on the right hemisphere increased significantly over time. At the end of 4-wk rTMS the abnormal hemispheric laterality found in the group randomized to active rTMS normalized. The results of the first randomized sham-controlled trial of SMA stimulation in the treatment of resistant OCD support further investigation into the potential therapeutic applications of rTMS in this disabling condition.  MP: This pilot study was designed to assess the efficacy of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) by means of a double-cone coil in patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. We hypothesized that low-frequency stimulation of the OFC would lead to a reduction in clinical symptoms, as measured on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). A randomized, double-blind, crossover design was implemented with two 1-week treatment periods (active stimulation versus sham stimulation) separated by a 1-month washout period. Concomitantly, a subgroup of patients underwent a positron emission tomography (PET) scan after each stimulation sequence. Statistical analyses compared the Y-BOCS scores at the end of each period. At day 7, we observed a significant decrease from baseline in the Y-BOCS scores, after both active (P<0.01) and sham stimulation (P=0.02). This decrease tended to be larger after active stimulation than after sham stimulation: −6 (−29, 0) points versus −2 (−20, 4) points (P=0.07). Active versus sham PET scan contrasts showed that stimulation was related to a bilateral decrease in the metabolism of the OFC. The OFC should definitely be regarded as a key neuroanatomical target for rTMS, as it is easier to reach than either the striatum or the subthalamic nucleus, structures favored in neurosurgical approaches.  MP: Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been explored in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, but with negative or conflicting results. This randomized double-blind study was designed to assess the efficacy of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the presupplementary area.  Methods: Forty medication-resistant patients were assigned to 4 weeks of either active or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the presupplementary area with the help of a neuronavigation system.  Results: According to the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale, the baseline-week 4 evolution showed no significant differences between groups. Responder rates at week 4 were not different between groups (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 10.5% vs sham 20%; P=.63).  Conclusion: Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the presupplementary area seems ineffective for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, at least in severe and drug-refractory cases such as those included in this study. Further research is required to determine profiles of responder patients and appropriate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation parameters for obsessive-compulsive disorder.  MP: BBackground: The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); functional neuroimaging studies indicate that OCD symptoms are associated with increased activity in the OFC, caudate nucleus, thalamus, and anterior cingulate gyrus. The goal of our single-blind study was to assess whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left OFC would influence OCD symptoms in drug-resistant patients.Method: Twenty-three consecutively admitted right-handed inpatients with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed drug-resistant OCD were given rTMS (80% motor threshold, 1 Hz seconds per minute for 10 minutes every day for 15 days) to the left OFC parallel (active: n = 16) or perpendicular (sham: n = 7) to the scalp. The patients' OCD symptoms, mood, and anxiety were rated at baseline, at the end of treatment, and once every 2 weeks for 3 months after treatment. Data were gathered from June 2006 to November 2007.Results: Considering changes in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores with 2-way analysis of variance for repeated measures for a total of 8 observations (before rTMS, after treatment, and every 2 weeks for 12 weeks' follow-up), we found significant reduction of YBOCS scores comparing active versus sham treatment for 10 weeks after the end of rTMS (P <.02), with loss of significance after 12 weeks (P <.06). We also found a reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms but not a significant difference in the 2 groups.Conclusions: Low-frequency rTMS of the left OFC produced significant but time-limited improvement in OCD patients compared to sham. ackground: The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); functional neuroimaging studies indicate that OCD symptoms are associated with increased activity in the OFC, caudate nucleus, thalamus, and anterior cingulate gyrus.

"Currently, no pharmacotherapy is routinely used for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recently, combined noradrenergic plus antimuscarinic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of OSA in several trials. This systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines investigated the efficacy and safety of this combination drug regimen for the treatment of OSA. Seven databases were systematically screened for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying combined noradrenergic plus antimuscarinic agents for OSA to April 2022. Nine RCTs were identified for systematic review and five for meta-analysis. There were significant differences between OSA patients taking noradrenergic plus antimuscarinic agents and placebo with respect to sleep apnea-hypopnea index [mean difference (MD) −11.27 events/h, 95%CI (−21.69, −0.84) events/h; P = 0.03]; nadir oxygen saturation [MD 5.06%, 95% CI (2.57, 7.55)%; P < 0.0001], and arousal index [MD -8.17 events/h, 95% CI (−15.01, −1.33) events/h; P = 0.02] but not sleep efficiency. Our systematic review revealed that drug therapy modestly improved loop gain and upper airway collapsibility but decreased arousal threshold. A combination of noradrenergic and antimuscarinic agents administered orally before bedtime on one night significantly reduced OSA severity and improved OSA upper airway function. The long-term efficacy and safety of drug combinations in OSA patients now require further study.","MP: Background: The recent discovery that a combination of noradrenergic and antimuscarinic drugs improved upper airway muscle function during sleep and reduced OSA severity has revitalized interest in pharmacologic therapies for OSA. Research Question: Would 1 week of reboxetine plus oxybutynin (Reb-Oxy) be effective on OSA severity? Study Design and Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial was performed comparing 4 mg reboxetine plus 5 mg oxybutynin (Reb-Oxy) vs placebo in patients with OSA. After a baseline in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG), patients underwent PSGs after 7 nights of Reb-Oxy and 7 nights of placebo to compare apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which was the primary outcome. Response rate was based on the percentage of subjects with a ≥ 50% reduction in AHI from baseline. Secondary outcomes included Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score and psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) values. Home oximetry evaluated overnight oxygen desaturation index (ODI) throughout treatment. Results: Sixteen subjects aged 57 [51-61] years (median [interquartile range]) with a BMI of 30 [26-36] kg/m2 completed the study. Reb-Oxy lowered AHI from 49 [35-57] events per hour at baseline to 18 [13-21] events per hour (59% median reduction) compared with 39 [29-48] events per hour (6% median reduction) with placebo (P <.001). Response rate for Reb-Oxy was 81% vs 13% for placebo (P <.001). Although ESS scores were not significantly lowered, PVT median reaction time decreased from 250 [239-312] ms at baseline to 223 [172-244] ms on Reb-Oxy vs 264 [217-284] ms on placebo (P <.001). Home oximetry illustrated acute and sustained improvement in the oxygen desaturation index on Reb-Oxy vs placebo. Interpretation: The administration of Reb-Oxy greatly decreased OSA severity and increased vigilance. These results highlight potential possibilities for pharmacologic treatment of OSA.  MP: Rationale: There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recent investigations indicate that drugs with noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects improve genioglossus muscle activity and upper airway patency during sleep.  Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of the combination of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine) and an antimuscarinic (oxybutynin) on OSA severity (apnea–hypopnea index [AHI]; primary outcome) and genioglossus responsiveness (secondary outcome) in people with OSA.  Methods: A total of 20 people completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial comparing 1 night of 80 mg atomoxetine plus 5 mg oxybutynin (ato–oxy) to placebo administered before sleep. The AHI and genioglossus muscle responsiveness to negative esophageal pressure swings were measured via in-laboratory polysomnography. In a subgroup of nine patients, the AHI was also measured when the drugs were administered separately.  Measurements and Main Results: The participants’ median (interquartile range) age was 53 (46–58) years and body mass index was 34.8 (30.0–40.2) kg/m2. ato–oxy lowered AHI by 63% (34–86%), from 28.5 (10.9–51.6) events/h to 7.5 (2.4–18.6) events/h (P < 0.001). Of the 15/20 patients with OSA on placebo (AHI > 10 events/hr), AHI was lowered by 74% (62–88%) (P < 0.001) and all 15 patients exhibited a ≥50% reduction. Genioglossus responsiveness increased approximately threefold, from 2.2 (1.1–4.7)%/cm H2O on placebo to 6.3 (3.0 to 18.3)%/cm H2O on ato–oxy (P < 0.001). Neither atomoxetine nor oxybutynin reduced the AHI when administered separately.  Conclusions: A combination of noradrenergic and antimuscarinic agents administered orally before bedtime on 1 night greatly reduced OSA severity. These findings open new possibilities for the pharmacologic treatment of OSA.  MP: The combination of the noradrenergic agent atomoxetine plus the antimuscarinic oxybutynin has recently been shown to improve upper airway physiology and reduce obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity. However, the effects of different antimuscarinics when combined with atomoxetine is limited. This study aimed to determine the effects of atomoxetine combined with two different antimuscarinics with varying M-subtype receptor selectivity on OSA severity and upper airway physiology. Ten people with predominantly severe OSA completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Participants completed three overnight in-laboratory sleep studies after either 80 mg atomoxetine + 5 mg solifenacin succinate (ato-sol) or 80 mg atomoxetine + 2 mg biperiden hydrochloride (ato-bip) or placebo. OSA severity, ventilatory stability (loop gain), respiratory-arousal threshold (via epiglottic manometry), next-day subjective sleepiness [Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)], and alertness were compared between conditions. Neither drug combination altered the apnea/hypopnea index versus placebo (P = 0.63). Ato-sol caused a shift toward milder respiratory events with reduced frequency of obstructive apneas (13 ± 14 vs. 22 ± 17 events/h; means ± SD, P = 0.04) and increased hypopneas during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) (38 ± 21 vs. 24 ± 18 events/h, P = 0.006) with improved nadir oxygenation versus placebo (83 ± 4 vs. 80 ± 8%, P = 0.03). Both combinations reduced loop gain by ∼10% versus placebo; sleep efficiency and arousal threshold were unaltered. Ato-bip reduced next-day sleepiness versus placebo (KSS = 4.3 ± 2.2 vs. 5.6 ± 1.6, P = 0.03). Atomoxetine + biperiden hydrochloride reduces perceived sleepiness, and atomoxetine + solifenacin modestly improves upper airway function in people with OSA but to a lesser extent versus recently published atomoxetine + oxybutynin (broad M-subtype receptor selectivity) findings. These results provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of noradrenergic and antimuscarinic agents on sleep and breathing and are important for pharmacotherapy development for OSA.  MP: "
"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne viruses that have caused several outbreaks worldwide. Aedes mosquitoes transmit these viruses mainly through sylvatic and urban transmission cycles. In the sylvatic cycle, nonhuman primates (NHPs) can be infected with CHIKV and ZIKV and may play an essential role as reservoirs for virus transmission. To improve our knowledge on the role of NHPs in the sylvatic cycle, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis study on the seroprevalence of CHIKV and ZIKV worldwide in NHPs. According to the PRISMA guidelines, 17 CHIKV and 16 ZIKV seroprevalence studies in NHPs from 3 online databases: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were selected. Data were extracted, including location and study year, type of NHP, sample size, serological tests, and seropositivity. All included studies have high-quality scores, between 5 and 8, corresponding to the grading criteria. Seroprevalence estimation was pooled using the ‘meta’ package in the R statistical software. The estimated pooled seroprevalence of CHIKV and ZIKV in NHP was 17% (95%CI: 5–34, I2: 99%, p < 0.05) and 6% (95% CI: 2–12, I2: 92%, p < 0.05), respectively. Most of the NHPs tested were wild Old World monkeys. The subgroup was analyzed by continents; high seropositive CHIKV and ZIKV were found in African NHPs at 35% (95% CI 9–66.0, I2 = 100) and 16% (95% CI 1–44, I2 = 97), respectively. While NHPs in America have 7% (95% CI 0-28, I2 = 99) and 2% (95% CI 1-3, I2 = 54) against CHIKV and ZIKV. In Asia, 6% (95% CI: 5–34, I2 = 96) CHIKV seroprevalence and 7% (95% CI 0–20, I2 = 98) ZIKV seroprevalence were found in NHP. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the seroprevalence of CHIKV and ZIKV among NHPs in various regions.","MP: The following is based largely on the authors' summary and conclusions. In the course of mainly routine surveillance work in the vicinity of Entebbe, Uganda, in 1968, 15 strains of chikungunya virus were isolated from man or mosquitos. These comprised nine strains from Aedes africanus (Theo.) collected from the Zika forest in March-May, one strain in March from a mosquito collector who had been working at the Zika forest, four strains in April-June. from patients whose homes were scattered over the Entebbe peninsula, and one strain from Mansonia fuscopennata (Theo.) collected at the Zika forest in June. Intensified mosquito collections in the immediate vicinity of Entebbe township from April to July failed to yield further isolations. Haemagglutination inhibition tests on the sera of a small sample of redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius schmidtï) collected in November 1968 and January 1969 and a larger sample collected in August-October 1969 revealed a high incidence of immunity to chikungunya, indicating their recent involvement with the virus. The evidence indicates that there was an intensive epizootic in forest monkeys transmitted by A. africanus with incidental leakage to man by inefficient vector systems, which could not maintain an outbreak by themselves. There is no evidence that chikungunya virus is maintained within the Entebbe area, even in a latent form, during the intervals of 5 to 8 or 10 years between epizootics. The similar but not coincident periodicity of 5 to 8 years exhibited by Zika virus supports the view that this is an intrinsic perodicity brought about by the dynamics of immunity in forest monkey populations. The possible explanation of such periodicity is that the virus approaches an over-all balanced enzootic status within a larger maintenance area, despite the evidence of travelling epizootics at more limited sites.  MP: Vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens have comprised a significant proportion of the emerging infectious diseases in humans in recent decades. The role of many wildlife species as reservoirs for arthropod-borne viral pathogens is poorly understood. We investigated the exposure history of various African wildlife species from the Congo basin to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphaviruses by testing archived serum samples. Sera from 24 African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), 34 African elephants (Loxodonta africana), 40 duikers (Cephalophus and Philantomba spp.), 25 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), 32 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), five Grauer’s gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri), two L’Hoest’s monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), two golden monkeys (Cercopithecus kandti), and three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) sampled between 1991 and 2009 were tested for antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), o’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and yellow fever virus (YFV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. Specific neutralizing antibodies against ONNV were found in African forest buffalo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Gabon, duikers in the DRC, and mandrills in Gabon, providing novel evidence of enzootic circulation of ONNV in these countries. African forest buffalo in the DRC and Gabon also demonstrated evidence of exposure to CHIKV, WNV, and DENV-2, while mandrills in Gabon were antibody positive for CHIKV, DENV-2, WNV, and YFV. All of the elephants tested had a strong neutralizing antibody response to WNV. We also document results from a survey of gorillas for arboviruses, of which 4/32 (13%) had antibody to an alphavirus or flavivirus. Overall, our results demonstrate a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against multiple arboviruses in wildlife in equatorial Africa.  MP: The role of terrestrial vertebrates in the epidemiology of chikungunya disease is poorly understood. We evaluated their exposure and amplification role during the 2006 chikungunya outbreak in the Indian Ocean. Blood samples were collected from 18 mammalian and reptile species from Reunion Island, Mauritius and Mayotte. Among the 1051 samples serologically tested for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), two crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and two ship rats (Rattus rattus) proved to be exposed to CHIKV. CHIKV RNA was not detected in 791 analyzed sera. Our results confirm the preferential infection of simian primates and suggest that other vertebrates played a poor or no role in CHIKV transmission during the 2006 outbreak.  MP: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a globally emerging pathogen causing debilitating arthralgia and fever in humans. First identified in Tanzania (1953), this mosquito-borne alphavirus received little further attention until a 2004 re-emergence in Kenya from an unknown source. This outbreak subsequently spread to the Indian Ocean, with adaptation for transmission by a new urban vector. Under the hypothesis that sylvatic progenitor cycles of CHIKV exist in Kenya (as reported in West Africa, between non-human primates (NHPs) and arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes), we pursued evidence of enzootic transmission and human spillover events. We initially screened 252 archived NHP sera from Kenya using plaque reduction neutralization tests. Given an overall CHIKV seroprevalence of 13.1% (marginally higher in western Kenya), we sought more recent NHP samples during 2014 from sites in Kakamega County, sampling wild blue monkeys, olive baboons, and red-tailed monkeys (N = 33). We also sampled 34 yellow baboons near Kwale, coastal Kenya. Overall, CHIKV seropositivity in 2014 was 13.4% (9/67). Antibodies reactive against closely related o’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) occurred; however, neutralization titers were too low to conclude ONNV exposure. Seroprevalence for the flavivirus dengue was also detected (28%), mostly near Kwale, suggesting possible spillback from humans to baboons. CHIKV antibodies in some juvenile and subadult NHPs suggested recent circulation. We conclude that CHIKV is circulating in western Kenya, despite the 2004 human outbreaks only being reported coastally. Further work to understand the enzootic ecology of CHIKV in east Africa is needed to identify sites of human spillover contact where urban transmission may be initiated.  MP: Arboviruses spillover into humans either as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a two-step jump from the reservoir to an amplification host species and thence to humans. Little is known about arbovirus transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the region around Kédougou, Senegal. Over 3 years, 737 monkeys were captured, aged using anthropometry and dentition, and tested for exposure to CHIKV by detection of neutralizing antibodies. Infant monkeys were positive for CHIKV even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of mosquitoes and when population immunity was too high for monkeys alone to support continuous transmission. We conclude that monkeys in this region serve as amplification hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.  MP: Background. In Senegal, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which is an emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus, circulates in a sylvatic and urban/domestic cycle and has caused sporadic human cases and epidemics since 1960s. However, the real impact of the CHIKV sylvatic cycle in humans and mechanisms underlying its emergence still remains unknown. Methodology. One thousand four hundred nine suspect cases of CHIKV infection, recruited from 5 health facilities located in Kedougou region, south-eastern Senegal, between May 2009 to March 2010, together with 866 serum samples collected from schoolchildren from 4 elementary schools in May and November 2009 from Kedougou were screened for anti-CHIKV immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibodies and, when appropriate, for viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) and virus isolation. In addition, mosquitoes collected in the same area from May 2009 to January 2010 were tested for CHIKV by rPCR and by virus isolation, and 116 monkeys sera collected from March 2010 to May 2010 were tested for anti-CHIKV IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Results. The main clinical manifestations of the CHIKV suspect cases were headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. Evidence for CHIKV infection was observed in 1.4% (20 of 1409) of patients among suspect cases. No significant difference was observed among age or sex groups. In addition, 25 (2.9%) students had evidence of CHIKV infection in November 2009. Chikungunya virus was detected in 42 pools of mosquitoes, mainly from Aedes furcifer, and 83% of monkeys sampled were seropositive. Conclusions. Our findings further documented that CHIKV is maintained in a sylvatic transmission cycle among monkeys and Aedes mosquitoes in Kedougou, and humans become infected by exposure to the virus in the forest.  MP: Background Epidemic arbovirus transmission occurs among humans by mosquito bites and the sylvatic transmission cycles involving non-human primates (NHPs) still exists. However, limited data are available on the extent in NHPs infections and their role. In this study, we have developed and validated a high-throughput serological screening tool to study the circulation of multiple arboviruses that represent a significant threat to human health, in NHPs in Central Africa.  Methodology/Principal findings Recombinant proteins NS1, envelope domain-3 (DIII) for the dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), usutu (USUV), west nile (WNV) and zika (ZIKV) and envelope 2 for the chikungunya (CHIKV) and o'nyong-nyong (ONNV) were coupled to Luminex beads to detect IgG directed against these viruses. Evaluation of test performance was made using 161 human sera of known arboviral status (66 negative and 95 positive). The sensitivity and specificity of each antigen were determined by statistical methods and ROC curves (except for ONNV and USUV). All NS1 antigens (except NS1-YFV), CHIKV-E2 and WNV-DIII had sensitivities and specificities > 95%. For the other DIII antigens, the sensitivity was low, limiting the interest of their use for seroprevalence studies. Few simultaneous reactions were observed between the CHIKV+ samples and the NS1 antigens to the non-CHIKV arboviruses. On the other hand, the DENV+ samples crossed-reacted with NS1 of all the DENV serotypes (1 to 4), as well as with ZIKV, USUV and to a lesser extent with YFV. A total of 3,518 samples of 29 species of NHPs from Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were tested against NS1 (except YFV), E2 (CHIKV/ONNV) and DIII (WNV) antigens. In monkeys (n = 2,100), the global prevalence varied between 2 and 5% for the ten antigens tested. When we stratified by monkey’s biotope, the arboreal species showed the highest reactivity. In monkeys from Cameroon, the highest IgG prevalence were observed against ONNV-E2 and DENV2-NS1 with 3.95% and 3.40% respectively and in DRC, ONNV-E2 (6.63%) and WNV-NS1 (4.42%). Overall prevalence was low in apes (n = 1,418): ranging from 0% for USUV-NS1 to 2.6% for CHIKV-E2. However, a very large disparity was observed among collection site and ape species, e.g. 18% (9/40) and 8.2% (4/49) of gorillas were reactive with CHIKV-E2 or WNV-NS1, respectively in two different sites in Cameroon.  Conclusions/Significance We have developed a serological assay based on Luminex technology, with high specificity and sensitivity for simultaneous detection of antibodies to 10 antigens from 6 different arboviruses. This is the first study that evaluated on a large scale the presence of antibodies to arboviruses in NHPs to evaluate their role in sylvatic cycles. The overall low prevalence (<5%) in more than 3,500 NHPs samples from Cameroon and the DRC does not allow us to affirm that NHP are reservoirs, but rather, intermediate hosts of these viruses.  MP: Sera from 136 sub-human primates representing six genera were tested for the presence of antibody to Chikungunya, Semliki Forest Kumba strain, Onyong-nyong strain MP 87 and Mayaro strain B viruses. Twenty-six per cent of the sera tested were positive for N antibody to one or more of these agents. The extensive serologic overlap occurring between these viruses precluded any definitive interpretation of the results as to which virus may have been the specific infecting agent. Thirteen per cent of the sera tested were positive for CF and HI antibody to CHIK virus. In every instance a positive CF and HI response was associated with the presence of N antibody. Attempts at viral isolation from those sera of recent imports showing CF and HI antibody were unsuccessful.  That extreme care should be exercised in the selection of lower primates for purposes of studying exotic viral agents is clearly indicated by the data presented. Although no viremia was found in the animals tested, adherence to a rigid program of housing and protective screening is essential if a serious transmission hazard is to be minimized, particularly in areas of high arthropod activity.  MP: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in the Americas in 2013. Limited antigenic variability of CHIKV and ZIKV may restrict urban transmission cycles due to population protective immunity. In Africa, sylvatic transmission cycles involving nonhuman primates (NHP) are known for CHIKV and ZIKV, causing cyclic reemergence in humans. To evaluate whether sylvatic cycles can be expected in Latin America, we tested 207 NHP collected between 2012 and 2017 in urban and peri-urban settings in Brazil for infection with ZIKV and CHIKV. No animal tested positive for viral RNA in genus-specific and species-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays. In contrast, six animals (2.9%) from the families Atelidae, Callitrichidae, and Cebidae showed ZIKV-specific antibodies and 11 (5.3%) showed CHIKV-specific antibodies in plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Reactivity was monotypic against either ZIKV or CHIKV in all cases, opposing unspecific virucidal activity of sera. PRNT endpoint titers were low at 1:40 in all NHP, and positive specimens did not correspond to the likely dispersal route and time of introduction of both arboviruses. All antibody-positive samples were therefore tested against the NHP-associated yellow fever virus (YFV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) and against the human-associated dengue virus (DENV) by PRNT. Two ZIKV-positive samples were simultaneously DENV positive and two CHIKV-positive samples were simultaneously MAYV positive, at titers of 1:40 to 1:160. This suggested cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous alphaviruses and flaviviruses in 24% of ZIKV-positive/CHIKV-positive sera. In sum, low seroprevalence, invariably low antibody titers, and the distribution of positive specimens call into question the capability of ZIKV and CHIKV to infect New World NHP and establish sylvatic transmission cycles.  MP: Background: Dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses (DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV) are transmitted in sylvatic transmission cycles between non-human primates and forest (sylvan) mosquitoes in Africa and Asia. It remains unclear if sylvatic cycles exist or could establish themselves elsewhere and contribute to the epidemiology of these diseases. The Caribbean island of St. Kitts has a large African green monkey (AGM) (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) population and is therefore ideally suited to investigate sylvatic cycles. Methods: We tested 858 AGM sera by ELISA and PRNT for virus-specific antibodies and collected and identified 9704 potential arbovirus vector mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were homogenized in 513 pools for testing by viral isolation in cell culture and by multiplex RT-qPCR after RNA extraction to detect the presence of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKVs. DNA was extracted from 122 visibly blood-fed individual mosquitoes and a polymorphic region of the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene (HMBS) was amplified by PCR to determine if mosquitoes had fed on AGMs or humans. Results: All of the AGMs were negative for DENV, CHIKV or ZIKV antibodies. However, one AGM did have evidence of an undifferentiated Flavivirus infection. Similarly, DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV were not detected in any of the mosquito pools by PCR or culture. AGMs were not the source of any of the mosquito blood meals. Conclusion: Sylvatic cycles involving AGMs and DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV do not currently exist on St. Kitts.  MP: A seroepidemiological study of arboviruses infecting 115 wild toque macaques (Macaca sinica) at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka showed a high prevalence of antibodies to dengue and Lumbo viruses. There was low seroprevalence of Chandipura (2/115) and Batai (1/115) virus antibodies, but no seropositivity to Chikungunya or Sindbis. There was no serological evidence of infection by Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in spite of large human epidemics in the study area, indicating that toque macaques are unlikely to be an epidemiologically relevant host in the maintenance cycle of JE virus.  MP: Wild populations of nonhuman primates live in regions of sylvatic arbovirus transmission. To assess the status of arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans, semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue-2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan groups as well as local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo. The present study demonstrates that orangutans are susceptible to arboviralinfections in the wild, although the impact of arboviral infections on this endangered ape remain unknown.  MP: Serum samples from 54 monkeys were collected from healthy individuals in a monkey farm in Luzon island, Philippines, in 1999, and examined by IgM-capture ELISA and indirect IgG ELISA for the presence of dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya (CHIK) viruses. The positive rates for IgM ELISA were 3.7, 35.2 and 14.8% against DEN, JE and CHIK, respectively. Higher positive rates were obtained when indirect IgG ELISA was used: 100% against flaviviruses (JE or DEN) and 59.3% against CHIK virus. The results indicate a high prevalence of flavivirus infections such as JE and DEN, and a lesser prevalence of CHIK virus infections, among monkeys in the Philippines. These findings suggest possible sylvatic transmission cycles of these viruses.  MP: Zoonotic pathogens such as arboviruses have comprised a significant proportion of emerging infectious diseases in humans. The role of wildlife species as reservoirs for arboviruses is poorly understood, especially in endemic areas such as Southeast Asia. This study aims to determine the exposure history of different macaque species from national parks in Thailand to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphavirus by testing the serum samples collected from 25 northern pigtailed macaques, 33 stump-tailed macaques, and 4 long-tailed macaques for the presence of antibodies against dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses by plaque reduction neutralization assay. Specific neutralizing antibodies against Dengue virus (DENV1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV) were mainly found in stump-tailed macaques, whereas neutralizing antibody titers were not detected in long-tailed macaques and pigtailed macaques as determined by 90% plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT90). One long-tailed macaque captured from the south of Thailand exhibited antibody titers against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), suggesting enzootic of this virus to nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Thailand. Encroachment of human settlements into the forest has increased the interface that exposes humans to zoonotic pathogens such as arboviruses found in monkeys. Nonhuman primates living in different regions of Thailand showed different patterns of arboviral infections. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild monkeys in Thailand strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in Thailand. The transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses among wild macaques may have important public health implications.  MP: The potential of macaque Macaca nemestrina leonina in Thailand to be infected by endemic arboviruses was assessed. The prevalence of antibodies of three arboviruses actively circulating in Thailand was determined by Plaque Reduction Neutralization assay procedures using samples from captive colonies in Northern Thailand. Out of 38 macaques, 9 (24%) presented reacting antibodies against dengue virus, 5 (13%) against Japanese encephalitis virus, and 4 (10%) against Chikungunya virus. Our results indicate that the northern pig-tailed macaque in Thailand can be infected by these arboviruses, inferring therefore that their virus specific vectors have bitten them. Given that, northern pig-tailed macaque represents an abundant population, living in close range to human or in peridomestic setting, they could play a role as potential reservoir host for arboviruses circulating in Thailand."
"Objectives To assess the effects of corticosteroid therapy for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Methods We comprehensively searched articles published in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP databases from January 1, 2019, to March 20, 2021.  Results A total of 6771 patients from eight prospective studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with lower mortality in severe COVID-19 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54–0.92, P = 0.009; I2 = 54.5%). Since the proportion of the RECOVERY (Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial included in the meta-analysis was as high as 71.88%, we removed it and recalculated the pooled OR. The results of the remaining seven studies still suggested such a survival benefit (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44–0.96, P = 0.030; I2 = 59.8%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested that the pooled OR of three studies using corticosteroids in the early stages of treatment was much lower (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.25–0.57, P < 0.001; I2 = 47.8%). However, after excluding the RECOVERY trial, the pooled OR of the remaining four studies with unspecific administration timing of corticosteroid therapy no longer supported this result (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.69–1.17, P = 0.415; I2 = 0.0%).  Conclusions In this meta-analysis, evidence based on seven randomized controlled trials and one prospective cohort study indicates that corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduction in the mortality of severe COVID-19, especially when administered at an earlier time.","MP: BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage. Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the final results of this assessment. RESULTS A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.  MP: Purpose To determine whether a 6-day course of methylprednisolone (MP) improves outcome in patients with severe SARS-CoV‑2 (Corona Virus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]). Methods The study was a multicentric open-label trial of COVID-19 patients who were aged ≥ 18 years, receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and with evidence of systemic inflammatory response who were assigned to standard of care (SOC) or SOC plus intravenous MP (40 mg bid for 3 days followed by 20 mg bid for 3 days). The primary outcome was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit, or requirement for noninvasive ventilation. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. Results A total of 91 patients were screened, and 64 were randomized (mean age70 ± 12 years). In the ITT analysis, 14 of 29 patients (48%) in the SOC group and 14 of 35 (40%) in the MP group suffered the composite endpoint (40% versus 20% in patients under 72 years and 67% versus 48% in those over 72 years; p = 0.25). In the PP analysis, patients on MP had a significantly lower risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (age-adjusted risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.20–0.89; p = 0.043). Conclusion The planned sample size was not achieved, and our results should therefore be interpreted with caution. The use of MP had no significant effect on the primary endpoint in ITT analysis; however, the PP analysis showed a beneficial effect due to MP, which consistent with other published trials support the use of glucocorticoids in severe cases of COVID-19.  MP: Importance  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with severe lung damage. Corticosteroids are a possible therapeutic option.  Objective  To determine the effect of hydrocortisone on treatment failure on day 21 in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute respiratory failure.  Design, Setting, and Participants  Multicenter randomized double-blind sequential trial conducted in France, with interim analyses planned every 50 patients. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19–related acute respiratory failure were enrolled from March 7 to June 1, 2020, with last follow-up on June 29, 2020. The study intended to enroll 290 patients but was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board.  Interventions  Patients were randomized to receive low-dose hydrocortisone (n = 76) or placebo (n = 73).  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, was defined as death or persistent dependency on mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. Prespecified secondary outcomes included the need for tracheal intubation (among patients not intubated at baseline); cumulative incidences (until day 21) of prone position sessions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and inhaled nitric oxide; Pao2:Fio2 ratio measured daily from day 1 to day 7, then on days 14 and 21; and the proportion of patients with secondary infections during their ICU stay.  Results  The study was stopped after 149 patients (mean age, 62.2 years; 30.2% women; 81.2% mechanically ventilated) were enrolled. One hundred forty-eight patients (99.3%) completed the study, and there were 69 treatment failure events, including 11 deaths in the hydrocortisone group and 20 deaths in the placebo group. The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, occurred in 32 of 76 patients (42.1%) in the hydrocortisone group compared with 37 of 73 (50.7%) in the placebo group (difference of proportions, –8.6% [95.48% CI, –24.9% to 7.7%]; P = .29). Of the 4 prespecified secondary outcomes, none showed a significant difference. No serious adverse events were related to the study treatment.  Conclusions and Relevance  In this study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, low-dose hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce treatment failure (defined as death or persistent respiratory support) at day 21. However, the study was stopped early and likely was underpowered to find a statistically and clinically important difference in the primary outcome.  MP: Introduction There are no determined treatment agents for severe COVID-19. It is suggested that methylprednisolone, as an immunosuppressive treatment, can reduce the inflammation of the respiratory system in COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a single-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial involving severe hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the early pulmonary phase of the illness in Iran. The patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio by the block randomisation method to receive standard care with methylprednisolone pulse (intravenous injection, 250 mg·day−1 for 3 days) or standard care alone. The study end-point was the time of clinical improvement or death, whichever came first. Primary and safety analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Results 68 eligible patients underwent randomisation (34 patients in each group) from April 20, 2020 to June 20, 2020. In the standard care group, six patients received corticosteroids by the attending physician before the treatment and were excluded from the overall analysis. The percentage of improved patients was higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the standard care group (94.1% versus 57.1%) and the mortality rate was significantly lower in the methylprednisolone group (5.9% versus 42.9%; p<0.001). We demonstrated that patients in the methylprednisolone group had a significantly increased survival time compared with patients in the standard care group (log-rank test: p<0.001; hazard ratio 0.293, 95% CI 0.154–0.556). Two patients (5.8%) in the methylprednisolone group and two patients (7.1%) in the standard care group showed severe adverse events between initiation of treatment and the end of the study. Conclusions Our results suggest that methylprednisolone pulse could be an efficient therapeutic agent for hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients at the pulmonary phase.  MP: Background: Steroid use for COVID-19 is based on the possible role of these drugs in mitigating the inflammatory response, mainly in the lungs, triggered by SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed at evaluating at evaluating the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MP) among hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19. Methods: Parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged≥ 18 years with clinical, epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil. Patients were randomly allocated (1: 1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution), twice daily, for 5 days. A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT04343729. Findings: From April 18 to June 16, 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 randomized, and 393 analyzed as mITT, MP in 194 and placebo in 199 individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 81.3%. Mortality at day 28 was not different between groups. A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until day 7. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.  MP: Background: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have a high fatality rate likely due to a dysregulated immune response. Corticosteroids could attenuate this inappropriate response, although there are still some concerns regarding its use, timing, and dose. Methods: This is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study in critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted into Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Spain from 12th March to 29th June 2020. Using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting, we compared relevant outcomes between patients treated with early corticosteroids (before or within the first 48 h of ICU admission) with those who did not receive early corticosteroids (delayed group) or any corticosteroids at all (never group). Primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary endpoints included 7-day mortality, ventilator-free days, and complications. Results: A total of 691 patients out of 882 (78.3%) received corticosteroid during their hospital stay. Patients treated with early-corticosteroids (n = 485) had lower ICU mortality (30.3% vs. never 36.6% and delayed 44.2%) and lower 7-day mortality (7.2% vs. never 15.2%) compared to non-early treated patients. They also had higher number of ventilator-free days, less length of ICU stay, and less secondary infections than delayed treated patients. There were no differences in medical complications between groups. Of note, early use of moderate-to-high doses was associated with better outcomes than low dose regimens. Conclusion: Early use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality than no or delayed use, and fewer complications than delayed use.  MP: Importance  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with substantial mortality and use of health care resources. Dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients.  Objective  To determine whether intravenous dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days among patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS.  Design, Setting, and Participants  Multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in 41 intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil. Patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition, were enrolled from April 17 to June 23, 2020. Final follow-up was completed on July 21, 2020. The trial was stopped early following publication of a related study before reaching the planned sample size of 350 patients.  Interventions  Twenty mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 5 days, 10 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days or until ICU discharge, plus standard care (n =151) or standard care alone (n = 148).  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1, not hospitalized to 6, death), ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater organ dysfunction) at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days.  Results  A total of 299 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [14] years; 37% women) were enrolled and all completed follow-up. Patients randomized to the dexamethasone group had a mean 6.6 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 5.0-8.2) during the first 28 days vs 4.0 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 2.9-5.4) in the standard care group (difference, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.2-4.38; P = .04). At 7 days, patients in the dexamethasone group had a mean SOFA score of 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5-6.7) vs 7.5 (95% CI, 6.9-8.1) in the standard care group (difference, −1.16; 95% CI, −1.94 to −0.38; P = .004). There was no significant difference in the prespecified secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days, ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, or the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days. Thirty-three patients (21.9%) in the dexamethasone group vs 43 (29.1%) in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 (31.1%) vs 42 (28.3%) needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 (3.3%) vs 9 (6.1%) experienced other serious adverse events.  Conclusions and Relevance  Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days."
"Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), protein-bound uremic toxins, exacerbate the deterioration of renal function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The effects of microbiota-driven therapy (probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics) on decreasing circulating IS and PCS concentrations are controversial; thus, we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on circulating IS and PCS concentrations in CKD patients. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception to 22 July, 2021, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on circulating IS and PCS concentrations in CKD patients were included. In all, 14 RCTs with 513 participants were eligible for the meta-analysis. The effects of microbiota-driven therapy on the circulating IS and PCS concentrations were evaluated with weighted mean differences (WMDs) measured by a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. Compared with placebo, microbiota-driven therapy had no statistically significant effect on the circulating IS concentration (WMD: −1.64 mg/L; 95% CI: −3.46, 0.18 mg/L; P = 0.077) but it decreased the circulating PCS concentration (WMD: −2.42 mg/L; 95% CI: −3.81, −1.04 mg/L; P = 0.001). In the subgroup analyses, prebiotic (n = 6) and synbiotic (n = 3) supplementation significantly decreased the circulating PCS concentration, whereas probiotic (n = 3) supplementation did not. Meta-regression showed that the effects of microbiota-driven therapy were not associated with the supplementation time or the year of publication. Moreover, there was no significant evidence of publication bias. This review found that microbiota-driven therapy decreased the circulating PCS concentration in CKD patients. Additional large, well-designed RCTs with improved methodology and reporting are necessary to assess the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on circulating IS and PCS concentrations in the long term. ","MP: An imbalance of gut microbiota is considered a new cardiovascular risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, since it is directly associated with increased uremic toxin production, inflammation and oxidative stress. Strategies such as prebiotic supplementation have been suggested to mitigate these complications. We hypothesized that prebiotic-resistant starch could ameliorate uremic toxins levels, oxidative stress, and inflammatory states in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This pilot study evaluated 31 HD patients assigned to either resistant starch (16 g of resistant starch Hi-Maize® 260) or placebo (manioc flour) supplementation, which they received for 4 weeks on alternate days through cookies on dialysis days and powder in a sachet on non-dialysis days. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances plasma (TBARS), protein carbonylation, indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate were measured. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters, as well as, food intake were also evaluated. As expected, resistant starch group increased fiber intake (p > 0.01), in addition the prebiotic supplementation reduced IL-6 (p = 0.01), TBARS (p > 0.01), and IS (p > 0.01) plasma levels. No significant differences were evident in the placebo group. Prebiotic-resistant starch supplementation seems to be a promising nutritional strategy to improve inflammation, oxidative stress and to reduce IS plasma levels in CKD patients on HD.  MP: Objectives: This study was performed to determine the effects of probiotic supplementation on cholesterol-triglyceride ratio, an indirect marker of insulin resistance, protein-bound uremic toxins, biomarkers of inflammation, and microbial translocation in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis. Methods: Fifty-six patients aged 39–75 years were assigned into two groups to receive either probiotic sachets (n = 28) or a placebo (n = 28) in a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. The patients in the probiotic group received twice daily sachets that contained a mixture of three viable and freeze-dried strains: Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis LL358, Lactobaccillus salivarius LS159, and Lactobaccillus pentosus LPE588 at high dose (100 billion; 1 × 1011 cfu/day) for 6 months. Results: A total of 50 patients were available for final analysis. Probiotic supplementation did not have a significant influence on cholesterol-triglyceride ratio. Probiotic supplementation for 6 months caused a significant decrease in serum levels of indoxyl sulfate. Compared with the placebo, probiotic supplementation did not result in significant changes in hemoglobin levels, blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, serum p-cresyl sulfate, inflammatory, and microbial translocation markers. No clinically significant changes in body composition were observed between the two groups during the study period. The probiotic supplementation was well tolerated by all subjects with minimal adverse effects during the 6-month-long study. Conclusion: Our results suggest that high-dose multistrain lactobaccillus probiotic supplementation over 6 months as a monotherapy did not significantly decrease markers of insulin resistance, cholesterol-triglyceride ratio, and most of the studied markers, with the exception of levels of indoxyl sulfate in patients on HD.  MP: Objective The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota profile and inflammatory markers in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Design and Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Forty-six HD patients were assigned to receive 1 of 2 treatments: probiotic (n = 23; Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus e Bifidobacterialongum, 90 billion colony-forming units per day) or placebo (n = 23) daily for 3 months. Blood and feces were collected at baseline and after intervention. The inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were analyzed by immunoenzymatic assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Uremic toxins plasma levels (indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, and indole-3-acetic acid) were obtained by Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Routine laboratory parameters were measured by standard techniques. Fecal pH was measured by the colorimetric method, and the gut microbiota profile was assessed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis analysis. Results Sixteen patients remained in the probiotic group (11 men, 53.6 ± 11.0 year old, 25.3 ± 4.6 kg/m2) and 17 in the placebo group (10 men, 50.3 ± 8.5 year old, 25.2 ± 5.7 kg/m2). After probiotic supplementation there was a significant increase in serum urea (from 149.6 ± 34.2 mg/dL to 172.6 ± 45.0 mg/dL, P =.02), potassium (from 4.4 ± 0.4 mmol/L to 4.8 ± 0.4 mmol/L, P =.02), and indoxyl sulfate (from 31.2 ± 15.9 to 36.5 ± 15.0 mg/dL, P =.02). The fecal pH was reduced from 7.2 ± 0.8 to 6.5 ± 0.5 (P =.01). These parameters did not change significantly in placebo group. Changes in the percentage delta (Δ) between groups were exhibited with no statistical differences observed. The inflammatory markers and gut profile were not altered by supplementation. Conclusions Aprobiotic supplementation failed to reduce uremic toxins and inflammatory markers. Therefore, probiotic therapy should be chosen with caution in HD patients. Further studies addressing probiotic therapy in chronic kidney disease patients are needed.  MP: INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Probiotics have been suggested as a potential therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). They emerged in a context in which the dysbiosis in gut microbiota has become an important factor involved in the progression and complications of CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on inflammatory markers and uremic toxins plasma levels in non-dialysis CKD patients.  METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed on 20 non-dialysis CKD patients who were randomly assigned to receive probiotic supplement (n= 10; Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus e Bifidobacterialongum - 90 billion CFU per day) or placebo (n = 10) daily for three months. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were analyzed by Immunoenzymatic Assay (ELISA). Uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were obtained by Fluorescence High Performance Liquid Chromatography and, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS. The percentage of changes in the plasma levels of evaluated markers were compared between groups.  RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the study (probiotic group: n=7, 64.2 ± 7.2 yrs, 5 men, eGFR 34.6±12.7mL/min/1.73m2; placebo group: n=9, 63.4 ± 8.1yrs, 5 men, eGFR 37.7±13.7 mL/min/1.73m2). After probiotic supplementation there was a significant increase in IL-6 plasma levels (Table 1). There was no significant change in the average levels of CRP and uremic toxins assessed in probiotic group, in contrast, IAA levels were reduced after 3 months in placebo group. The percentage of changes were not different between groups, however, evaluating all patients (both groups), there was a positive correlation between the percentage (%) of change of p-CS plasma levels and the % of change of IL-6 plasma levels (r = 0.53, p= 0.04).  CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplementation failed to reduce plasma concentration of inflammatory markers and uremic toxins in CKD patients. Further studies need to confirm the unexpected pro-inflammatory potential of probiotics.  MP: Objective: The prebiotic fiber inulin has been studied in individuals undergoing hemodialysis (HD) due to its ability to reduce gut microbiota-derived uremic toxins. However, studies examining the effects of inulin on the gut microbiota and derived metabolites are limited in these patients. We aimed to assess the impact of a 4-week supplementation of inulin on the gut microbiota composition and microbial metabolites of patients on HD. Design and Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, twelve HD patients (55 ± 10 y, 50% male, 58% Black American, BMI 31.6 ± 8.9 kg/m2, 33% diabetes mellitus) were randomized to consume inulin [10 g/d for females; 15 g/d for males] or maltodextrin [6 g/d for females; 9 g/d for males] for 4 weeks, with a 4-week washout period. We assessed the fecal microbiota composition, fecal metabolites (short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), phenols, and indoles), and plasma indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate. Results: At baseline, factors that explained the gut microbiota variability included BMI category and type of phosphate binder prescribed. Inulin increased the relative abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and its genus Akkermansia (P interaction = 0.045). Inulin and maltodextrin resulted in an increased relative abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes and its genus Bacteroides (P time = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). Both treatments increased the fecal acetate and propionate (P time = 0.032 and 0.027, respectively), and there was a trend toward increased fecal butyrate (P time = 0.06). Inulin did not reduce fecal p-cresol or indoles, or plasma concentrations of p-cresyl sulfate or indoxyl sulfate. Conclusions: A 4-week supplementation of inulin did not lead to major shifts in the fecal microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites. This may be due to high variability among participants and an unexpected increase in fecal excretion of SCFA with maltodextrin. Larger studies are needed to determine the effects of prebiotic fibers on the gut microbiota and clinical outcomes to justify their use in patients on HD.   MP: Background Microbiota-derived uremic toxins have been associated with inflammation that could corroborate with endothelial dysfunction (ED) and increase cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of the prebiotic fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on endothelial function and arterial stiffness in nondialysis CKD patients.  Methods In a double-blind controlled trial, 46 nondiabetic CKD patients were randomized to receive 12 g/day of FOS or placebo (maltodextrin) for 3 months. Total p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate by high-performance liquid chromatography, urinary trimethylamine N-oxide by mass spectrometry, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum nitric oxide and stroma-derived factor-1 alfa were measured at baseline and at the end of follow-up; endothelial function was assessed through flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV).  Results The mean (± standard deviation) age of the study participants was 57.6 ± 14.4 years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 21.3 ± 7.3 mL/min/1.73 m2. During the follow-up, regarding the inflammatory markers and uremic toxins, there was a significant decrease in IL-6 levels (3.4 ± 2.1 pg/mL versus 2.6 ± 1.4 pg/mL; P = 0.04) and a trend toward PCS reduction (55.4 ± 38.1 mg/L versus 43.1 ± 32.4 mg/L, P = 0.07) only in the prebiotic group. Comparing both groups, there was no difference in FMD and PWV. In an exploratory analysis, including a less severe ED group of patients (FMD ≥2.2% at baseline), FMD remained stable in the prebiotic group, while it decreased in the placebo group (group effect P = 0.135; time effect P = 0.012; interaction P = 0.002).  Conclusions The prebiotic FOS lowered circulating levels of IL-6 in CKD patients and preserved endothelial function only in those with less damaged endothelium. No effect of FOS in arterial stiffness was observed.  MP: In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the accumulation of gut-derived metabolites, such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (pCS), and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), has been associated with the burden of the disease. In this context, prebiotics emerge as a strategy to mitigate the accumulation of such compounds, by modulating the gut microbiota and production of their metabolites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of unripe banana flour (UBF—48% resistant starch, a prebiotic) on serum concentrations of IS, pCS, and IAA in individuals undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted. Forty-three individuals on PD were randomized to sequential treatment with UBF (21 g/day) and placebo (waxy corn starch—12 g/day) for 4 weeks, or vice versa (4-week washout). The primary outcomes were total and free serum levels of IS, pCS, and IAA. Secondary outcomes were 24 h urine excretion and dialysis removal of IS, pCS, and IAA, serum inflammatory markers [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)], serum lipopolysaccharide LPS, and dietary intake. Of the 43 individuals randomized, 26 completed the follow-up (age = 55 ± 12 years; 53.8% men). UBF did not promote changes in serum levels of IS (p = 0.70), pCS (p = 0.70), and IAA (p = 0.74). Total serum IS reduction was observed in a subgroup of participants (n = 11; placebo: median 79.5 μmol/L (31–142) versus UBF: 62.5 μmol/L (31–133), p = 0.009) who had a daily UBF intake closer to that proposed in the study. No changes were observed in other secondary outcomes. UBF did not promote changes in serum levels of IS or pCS and IAA; a decrease in IS was only found in the subgroup of participants who were able to take 21g/day of the UBF.  MP: Background Microbial-derived uremic toxins, p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), have been associated with the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Prebiotics have emerged as an alternative to modulate the gut environment and to attenuate toxin production. This trial aims to investigate the effect of a prebiotic fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on uremic toxins of non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) patients.  Methods A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted for 3 months. In all, 50 nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL/min/1.73 m2], aged 18–80 years, were allocated to prebiotic (FOS, 12 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin, 12 g/day) groups. Primary outcomes were changes in serum (total and free) and urinary (total) PCS. Secondary outcomes included changes in IS, IAA, serum markers of intestinal permeability (zonulin), gut-trophic factors (epidermal growth factor and glucagon-like peptide-2), eGFR, inflammation (high sensitive c-reactive protein and interleukin-6), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, lipid profile and gastrointestinal symptoms.  Results From 50 participants (54% men, 57.3 ± 14.6 years and eGFR 21.4 ± 7.6 mL/min/1.73 m2), 46 completed the follow-up. No changes in dietary intake or gastrointestinal symptoms were observed. There was a trend in the difference of serum total ΔPCS (treatment effect adjusted for baseline levels: −12.4 mg/L; 95% confidence interval (−5.6 to 0.9 mg/L; P = 0.07) and serum-free Δ%PCS [intervention −8.6 (−41.5 to 13.9%) versus placebo 3.5 (−28.8 to 85.5%); P = 0.07] between the groups. The trend in the difference of serum total ΔPCS was independent of eGFR and dietary protein:fiber ratio intake. No difference was found in urinary PCS. Aside from the decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention, no differences were observed in the change of IS, IAA or other secondary outcome between the groups.  Conclusions Our result suggests the potential of FOS in reducing serum total and free PCS in nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients.  MP: Background Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (pCS), 2 important protein-bound uremic toxins, are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage renal disease. Indole and p-cresol are gut microbiome–generated precursors of IS and pCS.  Objective The aim of the present study was to determine whether inulin-type fructans (ITFs) reduce the production of indole and p-cresol by altering their producing bacteria in patients with peritoneal dialysis.  Methods Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis for >3 mo without diabetes and not using antibiotics were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ITF intervention over 36 wk (12-wk washout). The primary outcomes were gut microbiome, fecal indole and p-cresol, indole-producing bacteria, p-cresol-producing bacteria, and serum IS and pCS. The secondary outcomes were fecal pH, 24-h urine, and dialysis removal of IS and pCS.  Results Of 21 individuals randomly assigned, 15 completed the study. The daily nutrient intakes, including protein, tryptophan, and tyrosine, were isostatic during the prebiotic, washout, and placebo intervention. There were no baseline differences in the outcomes of interest between treatments. For fecal indole, its concentrations did not change significantly in either treatment. However, there was a trend toward the treatment-by-time effect (P = 0.052), with a quantitative reduction in the ITF treatment and an increase in the control. The difference in the changes between the 2 treatments was significant (−10.07 ± 7.48 μg/g vs +13.35 ± 7.66 μg/g; P = 0.040). Similar to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, there was a difference over time between the 2 treatments, with a significant treatment and time interaction effect (P = 0.047). There were no treatment, time, or interaction effects for fecal p-cresol, serum IS and pCS, 24-h urine, and dialysis removal of IS and pCS.  Conclusions Our results suggested that ITFs restricted the increase in gut microbiome–generated indole in patients with peritoneal dialysis.  MP: Objectives The generation of key nephrovascular protein-bound uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate and phenol, in hemodialysis (HD) patients is attributed to the dysbiotic gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of synbiotic supplementation on serum levels of indoxyl sulfate, phenol, inflammation, and biochemical parameters in HD patients.  Methods Forty-two HD patients (synbiotic group: n = 21; placebo group: n = 21) were analyzed in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. During a 2-mo intervention, the synbiotic group received two synbiotic capsules daily, between the main meals, whereas the placebo group received maltodextrin as the placebo. Blood pressure, uremic factors, and biochemical parameters were assessed before the start and after the end of the study.  Results After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no significant effect of synbiotic on serum levels of urea, creatinine, liver enzymes, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, blood pressure, or albumin in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. A significant increase in indoxyl sulfate and parathyroid hormone levels were observed only in the treatment group. However, between-group analyses were not significant. Compared with baseline values, phenol levels were decreased in both groups (P≤001), with no significant between-group difference.  Conclusions Synbiotic supplementation might increase indoxyl sulfate and parathyroid hormone levels in HD patients.  MP: Generation of uremic toxins p-cresylsulfate (p-CS), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) in hemodialysis (HD) individuals may be associated with the gut flora and recognized markers of disease progression. This study investigated the effect of synbiotic meal on uremic toxins in HD individuals. We conducted randomized singleblind and placebo-controlled intervention study with 58 HD subjects (20F/38M, 63.1 ± 10.9-old) who were randomly allocated in synbiotic group (SG, 40 g of extruded sorghum plus 100 mL of unfermented probiotic milk) or control group (CG, 40 g of extruded corn plus 100 mL of pasteurized milk), during 7-wk Metabolic markers and uremic toxins, fecal concentration of short chain fatty acid and pH value was determined. The SG group had decreased serum p-CS and IS, as well as decreased urea concentration (p <.05) compared to CG. SG showed higher fecal butyric acid and lower pH compared to baseline and SC (p <.05). In addition, serum p-CS and fecal pH were positively correlated to urea concentration in SG participants at the endpoint. The consumption of the synbiotic meal during 7-wk reduced colonic pH, and reduced serum uremic (p-CS and IS) toxins and urea in HD subjects.  MP: BaBackground and objectives The generation of key uremic nephrovascular toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), is attributed to the dysbiotic gut microbiota in CKD. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether synbiotic (pre- and probiotic) therapy alters the gut microbiota and reduces serum concentrations of microbiome–generated uremic toxins, IS and PCS, in patients with CKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Predialysis adult participants with CKD (eGFR=10–30 ml/min per 1.73 m2) were recruited between January 5, 2013 and November 12, 2013 to a randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled, crossover trial of synbiotic therapy over 6 weeks (4-week washout). The primary outcome was serum IS. Secondary outcomes included serum PCS, stool microbiota profile, eGFR, proteinuria-albuminuria, urinary kidney injury molecule-1, serum inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α), serum oxidative stress biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes and glutathione peroxidase), serum LPS, patient-reported health, Gastrointestinal Symptom Score, and dietary intake. A prespecified subgroup analysis explored the effect of antibiotic use on treatment effect. Results Of 37 individuals randomized (age =69±10 years old; 57% men; eGFR=24±8 ml/min per 1.73 m2), 31 completed the study. Synbiotic therapy did not significantly reduce serum IS (−2 μmol/L; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], −5 to 1 μmol/L) but did significantly reduce serum PCS (−14 μmol/L; 95% CI, −27 to −2 μmol/L). Decreases in both PCS and IS concentrations were more pronounced in patients who did not receive antibiotics during the study (n=21; serum PCS, −25 μmol/L; 95% CI, −38 to −12 μmol/L; serum IS, −5 μmol/L; 95% CI, −8 to −1 μmol/L). Synbiotics also altered the stool microbiome, particularly with enrichment of Bifidobacterium and depletion of Ruminococcaceae. Except for an increase in albuminuria of 38 mg/24 h (P=0.03) in the synbiotic arm, no changes were observed in the other secondary outcomes. Conclusion In patients with CKD, synbiotics did not significantly reduce serum IS but did decrease serum PCS and favorably modified the stool microbiome. Large–scale clinical trials are justified.ckground and objectives The generation of key uremic nephrovascular toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), is attributed to the dysbiotic gut microbiota in CKD.

Synbiotic therapy did not significantly reduce serum IS (−2 μmol/L; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], −5 to 1 μmol/L) but did significantly reduce serum PCS (−14 μmol/L; 95% CI, −27 to −2 μmol/L). Decreases in both PCS and IS concentrations were more pronounced in patients who did not receive antibiotics during the study (n=21; serum PCS, −25 μmol/L; 95% CI, −38 to −12 μmol/L; serum IS, −5 μmol/L; 95% CI, −8 to −1 μmol/L). Synbiotics also altered the stool microbiome, particularly with enrichment of Bifidobacterium and depletion of Ruminococcaceae. Except for an increase in albuminuria of 38 mg/24 h (P=0.03) in the synbiotic arm, no changes were observed in the other secondary outcomes. Conclusion In patients with CKD, synbiotics did not significantly reduce serum IS but did decrease serum PCS and favorably modified the stool microbiome. Large–scale clinical trials are justified."
"Background Elevated concentrations of serum inflammatory cytokines, specifically TNF-α and IL-6, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), are commonly observed after menopause.  Objectives Because soy isoflavones may have some anti-inflammatory potential, the aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to explore whether soy intake affects serum markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women.  Methods PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched up to August 2020. All RCTs that met the following criteria were included: 1) studies of the effects of soy intake on inflammatory markers; 2) any date of publication; 3) conducted on postmenopausal women; 4) with sufficient quantitative data for meta-analysis. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs. A total of 24 RCTs assessing the effects of soy intake on serum concentrations of CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 were included in the analysis. A random-effects model was used to determine the overall effect.  Results Soy supplementation significantly reduced CRP by 0.11 mg/L in postmenopausal women (95% CI: −0.22, −0.004 mg/L; P = 0.0414), but did not affect IL-6 or TNF-α. Significant reductions in CRP concentration occurred when natural soy products were given (WMD: −0.23 mg/L; 95% CI: −0.29, −0.17 mg/L; P < 0.001). This is equivalent to a ∼9% reduction in CRP concentration from baseline.  Conclusions Although our meta-analysis found evidence that soy products significantly reduce CRP concentrations in postmenopausal women, the mechanisms by which soy foods and their constituents affect inflammatory biomarkers still need to be clarified.","MP: Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), protein-bound uremic toxins, exacerbate the deterioration of renal function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The effects of microbiota-driven therapy (probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics) on decreasing circulating IS and PCS concentrations are controversial; thus, we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on circulating IS and PCS concentrations in CKD patients. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception to 22 July, 2021, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on circulating IS and PCS concentrations in CKD patients were included. In all, 14 RCTs with 513 participants were eligible for the meta-analysis. The effects of microbiota-driven therapy on the circulating IS and PCS concentrations were evaluated with weighted mean differences (WMDs) measured by a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. Compared with placebo, microbiota-driven therapy had no statistically significant effect on the circulating IS concentration (WMD: −1.64 mg/L; 95% CI: −3.46, 0.18 mg/L; P = 0.077) but it decreased the circulating PCS concentration (WMD: −2.42 mg/L; 95% CI: −3.81, −1.04 mg/L; P = 0.001). In the subgroup analyses, prebiotic (n = 6) and synbiotic (n = 3) supplementation significantly decreased the circulating PCS concentration, whereas probiotic (n = 3) supplementation did not. Meta-regression showed that the effects of microbiota-driven therapy were not associated with the supplementation time or the year of publication. Moreover, there was no significant evidence of publication bias. This review found that microbiota-driven therapy decreased the circulating PCS concentration in CKD patients. Additional large, well-designed RCTs with improved methodology and reporting are necessary to assess the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on circulating IS and PCS concentrations in the long term.   MP: OBJECTIVE—To determine the effects of soy consumption on markers of inflammation and endothelial function in postmenopausal women with the metabolic syndrome.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—This randomized cross-over clinical trial included 42 postmenopausal women with the metabolic syndrome. Participants were randomly assigned to consume a control diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH]), soy protein diet, or soy nut diet, each for 8 weeks. Red meat in the DASH diet (one serving/day) was replaced by soy protein in the soy protein diet and by soy nut in the soy nut diet.  RESULTS—For nitric oxide levels, the difference from the control diet was 9.8% (P < 0.01) on the soy nut and −1.7% (P = 0.10) on the soy protein diets. The difference from the control diet for serum E-selectin was −11.4% (P < 0.01) on the soy nut consumption and −4.7% (P = 0.19) on the soy protein diet. Soy nut consumption reduced interleukin-18 compared with the control diet (difference from the control diet: −9.2%, P < 0.01), but soy protein did not (difference from the control diet: −4.6%, P = 0.14). For C-reactive protein, the difference from the control diet was −8.9% (P < 0.01) on the soy nut diet and −1.6% (P < 0.01) on the soy protein diet.  CONCLUSIONS—Short-term soy nut consumption reduced some markers of inflammation and increased plasma nitric oxide levels in postmenopausal women with the metabolic syndrome.  MP: Background: This study ascertained the effects of soy, in the forms of textured soy protein (TSP) and soy nuts, on lipid profiles, apolipoproteins, inflammatory and prothrombotic markers, and blood pressure in elderly women diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: This was a 12-week parallel, randomized, controlled trial conducted in rural health centers of Babol, Iran. Participants were 75 women, ages 60-70 years, who were diagnosed with MetS. Subjects were randomized to one of the following 3 groups: i) soy nut (35g/d), ii) TSP (35g/d), and iii) control. Blood biochemical markers measured at baseline and at the end of the study included: triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, ApoB100, ApoAI, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen. Results: Soy nuts significantly improved LDL-C, VLDL-C, and ApoB100levels (P < 0.05), while fewer, significant improvements were observed in these variables in the TSP group compared to mean changes from baseline (P < 0.001). Similar results were found for ApoAI in the treatment groups (P < 0.01). Serum total cholesterol (TC) decreased significantly in the treatment groups compared with the control group (P < 0.005). Differences from the control group in terms of TG, HDL-C, fibrinogen, CRP, and blood pressure were not significant. Conclusion: Both forms of soy improved lipid profiles. The group that consumed soy nuts had greater improvement than the TSP group. Therefore, moderate daily intake of soy may be a safe, inexpensive, and practical method to improve the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and reduce the need for medical treatment.  MP: Objective: After menopause, women experience changes in body composition, especially an increase in fat mass. In addition, advancing age, decreased physical activity, and increased inflammation may predispose them to develop type 2 diabetes. Isoflavones have been shown to improve metabolic parameters in postmenopausal women. However, the effect of isoflavones on adipokines/cytokines remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of high-dose isoflavones on inflammatory and metabolic markers in postmenopausal women. Methods: We measured glucose, insulin, and adipokines/cytokines in 75 healthy postmenopausal women who were randomized to receive 20 g of soy protein with 160 mg of total isoflavones (64 mg genistein, 63 mg daidzein, and 34 mg glycitein) or 20 g of soy protein placebo for 12 weeks. Women taking estrogen discontinued therapy at least 3 months before the study. The supplements were given in a powder form and consumed once daily with milk or other beverages. Results: Mean ages in the placebo and active groups were similar (P = 0.4). Average time since menopause was 9 years, and two thirds of the women underwent natural menopause. There was no significant difference in body mass index at baseline between the groups (placebo, 25.1 kg/m 2; active, 26 kg/m 2) and it did not change significantly during the study. At baseline, the placebo group had significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor > (P < 0.0001); otherwise, there was no difference in any other parameter. After 12 weeks of treatment, there were significant positive changes in tumor necrosis factor α levels within the placebo group (P < 0.0001) and adiponectin levels within the isoflavone group (P = 0.03). Comparison of pre-post change between the groups showed a small but significant increase in serum adiponectin levels in the isoflavone group (P = 0.03) compared with the placebo group. No significant changes were seen in any other parameter between the two groups. Conclusions: Healthy, normal-weight postmenopausal women may not experience improvement in metabolic parameters when given high-dose isoflavones despite an increase in serum adiponectin levels. The role of isoflavones in obese and insulin-resistant postmenopausal women needs exploration.   MP: Objective: To evaluate the effects of soy isoflavone administration on endothelial function in healthy postmenopausal women. Design: Sixty naturally postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive isoflavone or placebo tablets for 6 months. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was measured by brachial reactivity technique along with levels of plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, P-selectin and soluble thrombomodulin, von Willebrand factor, and tissue plasminogen activator. Differences between endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation were assessed by evaluating brachial reactivity parameters after reactive hyperemia and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin; furthermore, in the active group, the effect of isoflavones was also evaluated during the intra-arterial infusion of N G-monomethyl-L-arginine. Serum levels of lipids [high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a)] and hemostatic factors (prothrombin, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibrin D-dimer) were also measured. To confirm the absorption of isoflavones, their blood concentrations were determined. Results: Isoflavone treatment versus placebo was associated with a significant improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation but had no impact on endothelial-independent arterial diameter and flow. Intra-arterial infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine inhibited the significant effect of isoflavones on endothelium-mediated vasodilatation. Furthermore, isoflavone group experienced statistically significant reductions in plasma concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. Levels of soluble thrombomodulin, von Willebrand factor, tissue plasminogen activator, lipids, and hemostatic factors did not change significantly throughout the study in both groups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a positive influence of soy isoflavones on endothelial function in healthy postmenopausal women as evidenced by an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and a reduction in plasma adhesion molecule levels.  MP: Background. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect, in postmenopausal women, of the phytoestrogen genistein and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on circulating two independent factors of cardiovascular risk: homocysteine and C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods. Ninety healthy postmenopausal women, from 50 to 60 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive genistein (n = 30; 54 mg/die) or continuous combined estrogen/progestin therapy (17-β-estradiol 1 mg plus norethisterone acetate 0.5 mg) or placebo. Plasma homocysteine and serum CRP were measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Results. In the genistein group, plasma homocysteine and serum CRP showed no statistically significant difference from baseline (homocysteine: 11.36±0.39 μmol/l; CRP: 1.73±0.31 mg/l) to 6 months treatment (homocysteine: 10.72±0.46 μmol/l; CRP: 2.13±0.45 mg/l), without any significant difference versus the placebo group (homocysteine: 11.25±0.43 μmol/l; CRP: 1.74±0.22 mg/l). In the HRT group there was a slight, but not significant reduction, of plasma homocysteine mean value from baseline (11.21±0.44 μmol/l) to 6 months treatment (10.45±0.38 μmol/l); whereas CRP mean value at the end of treatment (3.30±0.55 mg/l) was significantly higher from baseline (1.61±0.25 mg/l) (P<0.01). However, after 6 months, no significant difference existed with the other two groups. Conclusions. The phytoestrogen genistein, after 6 months treatment, does not modify the independent cardiovascular risk linked to circulating homocysteine or CRP level. Our experience confirms critical increase of CRP serum level after HRT treatment, but not plasma homocysteine significant variation.  MP: This study tested the effect of isoflavone supplementation in addition to combined exercise training on plasma lipid levels, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women. Thirty-two healthy and non-obese postmenopausal women without hormone therapy were randomly assigned to exercise + placebo (PLA; n = 15) or exercise + isoflavone supplementation (ISO; n = 17) groups. They performed 30 sessions of combined exercises (aerobic plus resistance) over ten weeks and consumed 100 mg of isoflavone supplementation or placebo. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast to analyze the lipid profile, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (FRAP), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), before and after ten weeks of the intervention. There were no differences in the changes (pre vs. post) between groups for any of the inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers or lipid profile variables. However, interleukin-8 was different between pre- and post-tests (p < 0.001) in both groups (Δ = 7.61 and 5.61 pg/mL) as were cholesterol levels (p < 0.05), with no interaction between groups. The combination of isoflavone supplementation and exercise training did not alter oxidative stress markers in postmenopausal women, but exercise training alone may increase IL-8 and decrease total cholesterol levels.  MP: Background/Objective: To investigate the effect of soy protein containing isoflavones on homocysteine (Hcy), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1).  Subject/Methods: In a randomized crossover design, 34 postmenopausal women consumed soy protein isolate (26±5 g protein containing 44±8 mg isoflavones per day) or milk protein isolate (26±5 g protein per day) for 6 weeks each. Fasting blood samples were collected at the end of each diet period and end points analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results: Concentrations of Hcy, CRP, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 were not different between soy and milk diet treatments. Results did not differ by equol production status or by baseline lipid concentration. Adjustment for intake of folate and methionine did not alter the Hcy results.  Conclusions: These data suggest that decreasing vascular inflammation and Hcy concentration are not likely mechanisms by which soy consumption reduces coronary heart disease risk.  MP: Background: Dietary isoflavones are thought to be cardioprotective because of their structural similarity to estrogen. The reduction of concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers by estrogen may be one of the mechanisms by which premenopausal women are protected against cardiovascular disease.  Objective: Our aim was to investigate the effects of isolated soy isoflavones on inflammatory biomarkers [von Willebrand factor, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and endothelin 1 concentrations]. Differences with respect to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in selected genes [estrogen receptor α (XbaI and PvuII), estrogen receptor β [ERβ (AluI) and ERβ[cx] (Tsp509I), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Glu298Asp), apolipoprotein E (Apo E2, E3, and E4), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (TaqIB)] and equol production were investigated.  Design: One hundred seventeen healthy European postmenopausal women participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover dietary intervention trial. Isoflavone-enriched (genistein-to-daidzein ratio of 2:1; 50 mg/d) or placebo cereal bars were consumed for 8 wk, with a washout period of 8 wk between the crossover. Plasma inflammatory factors were measured at 0 and 8 wk of each study arm.  Results: Isoflavones improved CRP concentrations [odds ratio (95% CI) for CRP values >1 mg/L for isoflavone compared with placebo: 0.43 (0.27, 0.69)]; no significant effects of isoflavone treatment on other plasma inflammatory markers were observed. No significant differences in the response to isoflavones were observed according to subgroups of equol production. Differences in the VCAM-1 response to isoflavones and to placebo were found with ERβ AluI genotypes.  Conclusion: Isoflavones have beneficial effects on CRP concentrations, but not on other inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal women, and may improve VCAM-1 in an ERβ gene polymorphic subgroup.  MP: Background:Soy protein or its components may protect against the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors total homocysteine (tHcy), C-reactive protein (CRP), and excess body iron, which generally increase with menopause.  Objective:The primary objective of this study was to determine the independent effect of the soy protein components isoflavones and phytate on CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women. The secondary objective was to identify factors [blood lipids, oxidative stress indexes, serum ferritin, plasma folate, plasma vitamin B-12, and body mass index (BMI)] contributing to tHcy and CRP concentrations.  Design:In a double-blind, 6-wk study, 55 postmenopausal women aged 47–72 y were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 soy protein (40 g/d) isolate treatments: native phytate and native isoflavone (n = 14), native phytate and low isoflavone (n = 13), low phytate and native isoflavone (n = 14), or low phytate and low isoflavone (n = 14). We measured iron indexes, tHcy, CRP, and BMI.  Results:Soy protein with native phytate significantly reduced tHcy (P = 0.017), transferrin saturation (P = 0.027), and ferritin (P = 0.029), whereas soy protein with native isoflavones had no effect on any variables. At baseline, BMI was highly correlated with tHcy (r = 0.39, P = 0.003) and CRP (r = 0.55, P < 0.0001), whereas HDL cholesterol was correlated with CRP (r = −0.30, P = 0.02). Multiple regression analysis showed that LDL cholesterol and BMI contributed significantly (R2 = 19.9%, P = 0.003) to the overall variance in tHcy.  Conclusion:Consuming phytate-rich foods and maintaining a healthy weight may reduce atherosclerotic CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women.  MP: Background & Aims: Observational studies note that regular dietary soy protein intake (6-11 g day-1) has a significant association with lower blood lipids; however, these observations have not been confirmed by clinical trials. This study aimed to ascertain the effects of moderate intake of soy protein (15 g) with isoflavones or isoflavones alone on serum lipid profiles, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and uric acid) and composite cardiovascular risk in Chinese postmenopausal, prediabetic women. Methods and Results: A double-blind randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 180 postmenopausal Chinese women with prediabetes or early untreated diabetes, aged 46-70 years and, on average, 6.0 years since menopause. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three arms to receive 15-g soy protein and 100-mg isoflavone (Soy group), or 15-g milk protein and 100 mg isoflavone (Iso group) or 15-g milk protein (placebo group) on a daily basis for 6 months. The results showed that no significant difference was observed in serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triaclyglycerol (TG), high sensitive C-reactive protein and a composite 10-year cardiovascular risk between the three groups at both 3 and 6 months. Serum uric acid marginally increased by 1.22% in the Soy group and decreased by 4.28% and 4.82% in the Iso and placebo groups at 3 months (P = 0.087), but no difference was observed at 6 months (P = 0.264). Conclusion: Soy protein with isoflavones or isoflavones alone at the provided dosage showed no significantly beneficial effects on measured cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal Chinese women with early hyperglycaemia.  MP: Background: Human studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of soy or isoflavones on bone metabolism. However, conflicting data remain. Equol is the intestinal metabolite of the isoflavone daidzein. The health benefits of soy are more pronounced in equol producers than those not producing equol. This 6-month randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effect of whole soy (soy flour) and purified daidzein on bone turnover markers (BTMs) in Chinese postmenopausal women who are equol producers. Methods: A total of 270 eligible women were randomized to either one of the three isocaloric supplements as follows: 40 g soy flour (whole soy group), 40 g low-fat milk powder + 63 mg daidzein (daidzein group), or 40 g low-fat milk powder (placebo group) given as a solid beverage daily for 6 months. The following fasting venous samples were collected at the baseline and end of the trial to analyze BTMs: serum cross-linked C-telopeptides of type I collagen, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide, and 25(OH)D3. Inflammation-related biomarkers, such as serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, transferrin, and homocysteine, were also tested to explore potential mechanisms. Results: A total of 253 subjects validly completed the study protocol. Urinary isoflavones suggested a good compliance to the treatments. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses indicated no significant difference in the 6-month or percentage changes in the parameters of bone metabolism and inflammatory markers among the three treatment groups. Conclusions: Whole soy and purified daidzein at provided dosages exhibited no significant effect on the bone metabolism and inflammation levels among Chinese equol-producing postmenopausal women.

"A significant increase in phosphorus-rich dairy wastewater coincides with a decrease in the availability of fossil phosphate rock resources in Europe. This confluence of events has led to the development of technologies for phosphorus recovery from dairy wastewater. This study aims to inform and guide such development with regard to life cycle environmental impacts prior to their implementation in dairy contexts. With the lack of inventory data at this point and the non-existence of earlier life cycle assessments on the use of phosphorus recovery technologies in a dairy context in literature, we performed a meta-analysis where we extracted and compared published results on life cycle environmental impacts from two fields (1) dairy industries, with a focus on the dairy wastewater treatment and (2) phosphorus recovery technologies in a municipal wastewater treatment context. The results show that despite its intended effect, normal dairy wastewater treatment in many cases still contributes significantly to eutrophication. Most of the phosphorus recovery technologies examined here exhibited a lower global warming potential and cumulative energy demand than those of dairy wastewater treatment processes. It indicates that problem shifting could be avoided when phosphorus recovery is introduced. However, no technologies involving incineration have had the impact of acidification reported which represents a potential knowledge gap since impacts are expected related to incineration emissions. A comparison between the extracted data for phosphorus recovery technologies shows that there are lower impacts related to technologies that recover phosphorus from the liquid phase, than from sludge or ash.","MP: Cheese production has always been the standard way of preserving milk. This is the second most consumed dairy product in Spain (ca. 6.2 kg per year and person), with more than 100 different cheeses available in the market. However, only 26 types are labelled with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), a symbol of quality recognition. In this study, an environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed to identify and quantify the environmental impacts (cradle-to-grave perspective) derived from the manufacture of one of the most popular and traditional PDO Galician cheeses: San Simon da Costa cheese. The most critical steps throughout the chain were identified. As expected, milk production at the dairy farm is the main environmental hot-spot in all categories assessed, with contributions ranging from 63% to 89%. Both feed production (mainly fodder) and on-farm emissions derived from enteric fermentation and manure management were the highest contributing farming activities. Cheese making activities should also be considered, with emphasis on impacts associated with the smoking process, the heating system and wastewater treatment. The studied dairy factory has not implemented a system for whey recovery due to its small-scale production. Thus, whey waste mixed with the wastewater effluent is sent to the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Therefore, the valorisation of whey into whey powder was considered as an alternative for improvement. Using this process modification, it is possible to achieve reductions in the environmental profile of the PDO San Simon cheese of up to 15% in categories such as eutrophication. In addition, attention must be paid to the environmental loads of whey powder production arising from electricity and heating requirements.  MP: Purpose A life cycle assessment was conducted to determine a baseline for environmental impacts of cheddar and mozzarella cheese consumption. Product loss/waste, as well as consumer transport and storage, is included. The study scope was from cradle-to-grave with particular emphasis on unit operations under the control of typical cheese-processing plants.  Methods SimaPro© 7.3 (PRé Consultants, The Netherlands, 2013) was used as the primary modeling software. The ecoinvent life cycle inventory database was used for background unit processes (Frischknecht and Rebitzer, J Cleaner Prod 13(13–14):1337–1343, 2005), modified to incorporate US electricity (EarthShift 2012). Operational data was collected from 17 cheese-manufacturing plants representing 24 % of mozzarella production and 38 % of cheddar production in the USA. Incoming raw milk, cream, or dry milk solids were allocated to coproducts by mass of milk solids. Plant-level engineering assessments of allocation fractions were adopted for major inputs such as electricity, natural gas, and chemicals. Revenue-based allocation was applied for the remaining in-plant processes.  Results and discussion Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are of significant interest. For cheddar, as sold at retail (63.2 % milk solids), the carbon footprint using the IPCC 2007 factors is 8.60 kg CO2e/kg cheese consumed with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 5.86–12.2 kg CO2e/kg. For mozzarella, as sold at retail (51.4 % milk solids), the carbon footprint is 7.28 kg CO2e/kg mozzarella consumed, with a 95 % CI of 5.13–9.89 kg CO2e/kg. Normalization of the results based on the IMPACT 2002+ life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) framework suggests that nutrient emissions from both the farm and manufacturing facility wastewater treatment represent the most significant relative impacts across multiple environmental midpoint indicators. Raw milk is the major contributor to most impact categories; thus, efforts to reduce milk/cheese loss across the supply chain are important.  Conclusions On-farm mitigation efforts around enteric methane, manure management, phosphorus and nitrogen runoff, and pesticides used on crops and livestock can also significantly reduce impacts. Water-related impacts such as depletion and eutrophication can be considered resource management issues—specifically of water quantity and nutrients. Thus, all opportunities for water conservation should be evaluated, and cheese manufacturers, while not having direct control over crop irrigation, the largest water consumption activity, can investigate the water use efficiency of the milk they procure. The regionalized normalization, based on annual US per capita cheese consumption, showed that eutrophication represents the largest relative impact driven by phosphorus runoff from agricultural fields and emissions associated with whey-processing wastewater. Therefore, incorporating best practices around phosphorous and nitrogen management could yield improvements.  MP: The present study investigated a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment to estimate the environmental impacts associated with Italian mozzarella cheese consumption. The differences between mozzarella produced from raw milk and mozzarella produced from curd were studied, and differences in manufacturing processes have been emphasized in order to provide guidance for targeted improvements at this phase. Specifically, the third-largest Italian mozzarella producer was surveyed to collect site-specific manufacturing data. The Ecoinvent v3.2 database was used for secondary data, whereas SimaPro 8.1 was the modeling software. The inventory included inputs from farm activities to end of life disposal of wasted mozzarella and packaging. Additionally, plant-specific information was used to assign major inputs, such as electricity, natural gas, packaging, and chemicals to specific products; however, where disaggregated information was not provided, milk solids allocation was applied. Notably, loss of milk solids was accounted during the manufacture, moreover mozzarella waste and transport were considered during distribution, retail, and consumption phases. Feed production and animal emissions were the main drivers of raw milk production. Electricity and natural gas usage, packaging (cardboard and plastic), transport, wastewater treatment, and refrigerant loss affected the emissions from a farm gate-to-dairy plant gate perspective. Post-dairy plant gate effects were mainly determined by electricity usage for storage of mozzarella, transport of mozzarella, and waste treatment. The average emissions were 6.66 kg of CO2 equivalents and 45.1 MJ of cumulative energy demand/kg of consumed mozzarella produced directly from raw milk, whereas mozzarella from purchased curd had larger emissions than mozzarella from raw milk due to added transport of curd from specialty manufacturing plants, as well as electricity usage from additional processes at the mozzarella plant that are required to process the curd into mozzarella. Normalization points to ecotoxicity as the impact category most significantly influenced by mozzarella consumption. From a farm gate-to-grave perspective, ecotoxicity and freshwater and marine eutrophication are the first and second largest contributors of mozzarella consumption to average European effects, respectively. To increase environmental sustainability, an improvement of efficiency for energy and packaging usage and transport activities is recommended in the post-farm gate mozzarella supply chain.  MP: Despite the significant role of small ruminant sector in the global trends of livestock productions, little research has been conducted on the environmental implications of dairy sheep production systems. Dairy sheep systems are relevant for the economy of many areas of the Mediterranean Basin and the environmental and economic optimization of their productive factors is considered an effective strategy for promoting the innovation and increasing the competitiveness of Mediterranean dairy sheep systems. Therefore, scientific studies are needed in order to propose specific greening strategies and to improve the environmental performances of dairy sheep systems. The main objective of this study was to define a preliminary characterization of the environmental profile of sheep milk (“Pecorino”) cheese chain in Sardinia (Italy), using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, with the following specific goals: i) comparing the environmental impacts caused by both the artisanal and the industrial manufacturing processes of “Pecorino” cheese and ii) identifying the hotspots to reduce the environmental impacts of the Sardinian dairy sheep sector. The analysis was based on the functional unit of 1 kg of artisanal “Pecorino di Osilo” cheese, and 1 kg of the industrial manufacturing cheese “Pecorino Romano PDO” cheese. The LCA highlighted that the GHG emissions of the two cheeses were similar, with an average value equal to 17 kg CO2-eq, largely due to enteric fermentation. The main differences between the two environmental profiles were found for human toxicity, ecotoxicity and eutrophication potential impact categories. Enteric methane emissions, feed supply chain, electricity, equipment and wastewater management seemed to be the hotspots where the environmental performances can be improved.   MP: The abolition of the milk quota system that was in place in Europe was abolished in 2015, which instigated an immediate increase in milk production in many European countries. This increase will aid in addressing the world's ever growing demand for food, but will incur increased stresses on the environmental impact and sustainability of the dairy industry. In this study, an environmental life cycle assessment was performed in order to estimate the environmental impacts associated with the manufacture of milk powder and butter in the Republic of Ireland. A farm gate to processing factory gate analysis, which includes raw milk transportation, processing into each product and packaging, is assessed in this study. Operational data was obtained from 5 dairy processing factories that produce milk powder (4 of which also produce butter). Results for each environmental impact category are presented per kilogram of product. Energy consumption (raw milk transportation and on-site electrical and thermal energy usage) contributes, on average, 89% and 78% of the total global warming potential, for milk powder and butter respectively, for the life cycle stages assessed. Similarly, energy consumption contributes, on average, 86% and 96% of the total terrestrial acidification potential for milk powder and butter respectively, for these life cycle stages. Emissions associated with wastewater treatment contribute approximately 10% and 40% to the total freshwater eutrophication potential and marine eutrophication potential, respectively, for both milk powder and butter production. In addition, packaging materials also has a significant contribution to these environmental impact categories for butter production. Results were also presented for three milk powder products being manufactured by the factories surveyed: skim milk powder, whole milk powder and full fat milk powder. The analysis presented in this paper helps to identify opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts associated with post-farm processing of milk powder and butter.  MP: The Canadian dairy sector is a major industry with about 1 million cows. This industry emits about 20% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the main livestock sectors (beef, dairy, swine, and poultry). In 2006, the Canadian dairy herd produced about 7.7 Mt of raw milk, resulting in about 4.4 Mt of dairy products (notably 64% fluid milk and 12% cheese). An integrated cradle-to-gate model (field to processing plant) has been developed to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of 11 Canadian dairy products. The on-farm part of the model is the Unified Livestock Industry and Crop Emissions Estimation System (ULICEES). It considers all GHG emissions associated with livestock production but, for this study, it was run for the dairy sector specifically. Off-farm GHG emissions were estimated using the Canadian Food Carbon Footprint calculator, (cafoo)2-milk. It considers GHG emissions from the farm gate to the exit gate of the processing plants. The CF of the raw milk has been found lower in western provinces [0.93 kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e)/L of milk] than in eastern provinces (1.12 kg of CO2e/L of milk) because of differences in climate conditions and dairy herd management. Most of the CF estimates of dairy products ranged between 1 and 3 kg of CO2e/kg of product. Three products were, however, significantly higher: cheese (5.3 kg of CO2e/kg), butter (7.3 kg of CO2e/kg), and milk powder (10.1 kg of CO2e/kg). The CF results depend on the milk volume needed, the co-product allocation process (based on milk solids content), and the amount of energy used to manufacture each product. The GHG emissions per kilogram of protein ranged from 13 to 40 kg of CO2e. Two products had higher values: cream and sour cream, at 83 and 78 kg of CO2e/kg, respectively. Finally, the highest CF value was for butter, at about 730 kg of CO2e/kg. This extremely high value is due to the fact that the intensity indicator per kilogram of product is high and that butter is almost exclusively fat. Protein content is often used to compare the CF of products; however, this study demonstrates that the use of a common food component is not suitable as a comparison unit in some cases. Functionality has to be considered too, but it might be insufficient for food product labeling because different reporting units (adapted to a specific food product) will be used, and the resulting confusion could lead consumers to lose confidence in such labeling. Therefore, simple units might not be ideal and a more comprehensive approach will likely have to be developed.  MP: The capability of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) in minimising waste and retaining the value of materials and energy within the biological and technical cycles in the Dairy Industry (DI) makes AD a critical instrument of transition to circular economy. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach for measuring the environmental performance of the anaerobic treatment of dairy processing effluents based on the circular economy principles. The potential of AD to close the water, energy and nutrient circular loops is investigated together with the relevant environmental costs and benefits at different levels of the dairy supply chain. The developed methodology was based on Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applied at three different system levels: the AD plant, the dairy processing facility, the entire dairy supply chain. The approach is demonstrated in a dairy facility coupled with a full-scale AD unit. The results show that the excess electricity (426 MWh/annum) and heat (1236 MWh/annum) produced from the AD plant cause significant reduction of the overall environmental impact of the processing facility. The recovered energy from AD provides 20% of the energy requirements of the factory reducing the total carbon footprint emissions by 13% compared to the baseline scenario.  MP: Rising water demands and pressures on water resources call for water management in industrial production. An eco-efficiency framework may provide justification for water consumption and treatment by combining environmental and economic dimensions in a life cycle perspective. We used principles of value added and value chain assessment (VCA) in the life-cycle system boundaries for a consistent assessment of eco-efficiency. The method was demonstrated for a membrane bioreactor-based, decentralized wastewater treatment and reuse in a dairy. The LCA results showed that decentralized wastewater treatment and reuse in the dairy will improve the aquatic environment by 80% (freshwater) and 51% (marine water), but increase the negative impact on climate change by 27% compared to conventional wastewater treatment. The VCA revealed that the decentralized alternatives would increase the value added by 1.3–1.4 €/m3 wastewater in the dairy, but also incur a value loss of 1.4–1.9 €/m3 for associated stakeholders such as the centralized wastewater treatment plant. The case study revealed the critical nature of a well-defined system boundary that includes impacts along the entire value chain and exposed pros and cons for decision-makers at both the system level and individual stakeholder level.  MP: Dairy processing uses a significant amount of water for processing and cleaning. Withdrawing and distributing water and treating wastewater represent significant costs to the Irish dairy processing industry. Stringent discharge limits also add pressure for water use efficiency, particularly during peak production months. Improving water use efficiency is therefore critical for Irish dairy processing. We conducted a detailed analysis of water use efficiency in 4 Irish dairy processing plants. Using farm gate to processor gate (gate-to-gate) life cycle assessment, we assessed on-site water data quality and investigated gate-to-gate volumetric water use and eutrophication potential (EP) for 3 common dairy products. We also benchmarked the on-site water use and water balance, characterized wastewater nutrient load, analyzed the influencers of on-site water use, and identified scope for increased water use efficiency. We found that condensate from evaporation represented a significant input at the site level (0.51 to 1.14 L/L of fresh water purchased or extracted from nature). In terms of gate-to-gate volumetric water use, butter used 1,326 to 1,843 m3/t of solids, with electricity being the largest contributor, whereas milk powders used 3,006 to 3,754 m3/t of solids, with electricity and ingredients being the largest contributors. Eutrophication of butter was found to be 0.51 to 0.77 kg of PO4 equivalents (eq)/t of solids, with transportation and nutrient emissions from wastewater treatment being the largest contributors. Eutrophication of milk powder was found to be 0.96 to 3.35 kg of PO4 eq/t of solids, and contributions varied depending on powder specifications. Milk intake water use and various leakages were found to be hotspots that could be managed to reduce water use on site. Comprehensive metering is urgently needed to improve water use efficiency in light of the ongoing expansion of dairy production and hence processing in Ireland. Significant opportunities exist to optimize operator behavior, water reuse, and off-site transportation and energy. This study represents the first attempt to define water efficiency opportunities both at the site level and along the supply chain. Processors need to be aware of off-site contributors that significantly affect both volumetric water use and environmental impacts of processed dairy products."
"Background and aims Metabolic diseases are globally popular, and a systematic review and meta-analysis of turmeric and curcuminoids on glucose metabolism among people with metabolic diseases was performed.  Design We comprehensively searched Web of Science, PubMed, Ovid (including EMBASE and MEDLINE), Scopus, the Cochrane Library and two Chinese databases, Wanfang and CNKI for RCTs that focused on the effects of turmeric and curcuminoids on fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), fasting serum insulin (FSI) and HOMA-IR among patients with metabolic diseases. The FBG and HbA1c were the main outcomes to be analyzed. With random-effects models, separate meta-analyses were conducted by inverse-variance and reported as WMD with 95% CIs.  Results Evidence from 17 RCTs including 22 trials showed that turmeric and curcuminoids lowered FBG by − 7.86 mg/dL (95% CI: −12.04, −3.67 mg/dL; P = 0.0002), HbA1c by − 0.38% (95% CI: −0.52%, −0.23%; P < 0.00001) and HOMA-IR by − 1.01 (95% CI: −1.6, −0.42; P = 0.0008). Moreover, they decreased fasting serum insulin by − 1.69 mU/L (95% CI: −3.22, −0.16 mU/L; P = 0.03) after more than 8 weeks of intervention in a subgroup analysis.  Conclusions Turmeric and curcuminiods decrease FBG, HbA1c and HOMA-IR significantly among subjects with metabolic disease. Additionally, they may have an effect on FSI concentrations if the intervention period is more than 8 weeks. However, attention should be paid to these outcomes due to the significant heterogeneity.","MP: Background: Oxidative stress and inflammation have been proposed as emerging components of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Curcuminoids are natural polyphenols with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Objective: To study the effectiveness of supplementation with a bioavailable curcuminoid preparation on measures of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with MetS. Our secondary aim was to perform a meta-analysis of data from all randomized controlled trials in order to estimate the effect size of curcuminoids on plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Methods: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 117 subjects with MetS (according to the NCEP-ATPIII diagnostic criteria) were randomly assigned to curcuminoids (n = 59; drop-outs = 9) or placebo (n = 58; drop-outs = 8) for eight weeks. Curcuminoids were administered at a daily dose of 1 g, and were co-supplemented with piperine (10 mg/day) in order to boost oral bioavailability. Serum activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and CRP were measured at baseline and at study end. Regarding the importance of CRP as a risk marker and risk factor of cardiovascular disease, a random-effects meta-analysis of clinical trials was performed to estimate the overall impact of curcuminoid therapy on circulating concentrations of CRP. The robustness of estimated effect size was evaluated using leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Results: Supplementation with curcuminoid-piperine combination significantly improved serum SOD activities (p < 0.001) and reduced MDA (p < 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.001) concentrations compared with placebo. Quantitative data synthesis revealed a significant effect of curcuminoids vs. placebo in reducing circulating CRP concentrations (weighed mean difference: -2.20 mg/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.96, -0.44; p = 0.01). This effect was robust in sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Short-term supplementation with curcuminoid-piperine combination significantly improves oxidative and inflammatory status in patients with MetS. Curcuminoids could be regarded as natural, safe and effective CRP-lowering agents.   MP: Building detection in complex scenes is a non-trivial exercise due to building shape variability, irregular terrain, shadows, and occlusion by highly dense vegetation. In this research, we present a graph based algorithm, which combines multispectral imagery and airborne LiDAR information to completely delineate the building boundaries in urban and densely vegetated area. In the first phase, LiDAR data is divided into two groups: ground and non-ground data, using ground height from a bare-earth DEM. A mask, known as the primary building mask, is generated from the non-ground LiDAR points where the black region represents the elevated area (buildings and trees), while the white region describes the ground (earth). The second phase begins with the process of Connected Component Analysis (CCA) where the number of objects present in the test scene are identified followed by initial boundary detection and labelling. Additionally, a graph from the connected components is generated, where each black pixel corresponds to a node. An edge of a unit distance is defined between a black pixel and a neighbouring black pixel, if any. An edge does not exist from a black pixel to a neighbouring white pixel, if any. This phenomenon produces a disconnected components graph, where each component represents a prospective building or a dense vegetation (a contiguous block of black pixels from the primary mask). In the third phase, a clustering process clusters the segmented lines, extracted from multispectral imagery, around the graph components, if possible. In the fourth step, NDVI, image entropy, and LiDAR data are utilised to discriminate between vegetation, buildings, and isolated building's occluded parts. Finally, the initially extracted building boundary is extended pixel-wise using NDVI, entropy, and LiDAR data to completely delineate the building and to maximise the boundary reach towards building edges. The proposed technique is evaluated using two Australian data sets: Aitkenvale and Hervey Bay, for object-based and pixel-based completeness, correctness, and quality. The proposed technique detects buildings larger than 50 m2 and 10 m2 in the Aitkenvale site with 100% and 91% accuracy, respectively, while in the Hervey Bay site it performs better with 100% accuracy for buildings larger than 10 m2 in area.  MP: Human studies of curcumin extract on lipid-lowering effect have not been completely investigated and have had controversy results. This study tested the effect of daily curcumin extract for 12 weeks on weight, glucose, and lipid profiles in patients with metabolic syndrome. Sixty-five patients were randomized into two groups; 33 patients taking curcumin extract capsule (630 mg thrice daily) and 32 patients taking a placebo capsule thrice daily for 12 weeks. At 12 weeks after the curcumin extract consumption, the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) significantly increased from 40.96 ± 8.59 to 43.76 ± 2.79 mg/dL (p < 0.05), and the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) was significantly reduced (120.55 ± 36.81 to 106.51 ± 25.02 mg/dL, p < 0.05). The triglyceride-lowering effect, a reduction of 65 mg/dL, was also found in this study. In subgroups analysis, the consumption of curcumin may have a lowering cholesterol effect in male patients and an increasing HDL-C effect in female patients, both of which result in a decrease of T-Chol/HDL-C ratio. The intake of the curcumin extract of 1890 mg/day for 12 weeks was associated with lipid-lowering effect but did not improve weight and glucose homeostasis in the patients with metabolic syndrome. Daily curcumin consumption may be an alternative choice to modify cholesterol-related parameters, especially in metabolic syndrome patients.

MP: In modern societies, metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a highly common disease, which is closely associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Metabolic syndrome is usually accompanied by low levels of adiponectin, which is a key regulator of insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation of the tissue. Adiponectin also reduces systemic insulin resistance and predicts cardiovascular disease. Curcumin has several beneficial effects on risk factors of metabolic syndrome. This polyphenol can affect almost all components of metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity. According to the low oral bioavailability of curcumin, several phospholipid-complex formulations have been developed to address this issue. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of unformulated curcumin and a phospholipid complex of curcumin on serum adiponectin in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Subjects (n = 120) with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to three groups which received capsules of phospholipidated curcumin (1 g/day), (n = 40), unformulated curcumin (n = 40) and placebo (n = 40) for a period of 6 weeks. The serum concentrations of adiponectin were measured at baseline and at the end of study using ELISA. The results showed a significant elevation of serum adiponectin concentrations in the curcumin group (mean change 28.9 ± 30.5) in comparison to both curcumin-phospholipid complex (mean change 4.1 ± 15.4) and placebo (mean change −3.5 ± 20.4) groups. Curcumin supplementation increased serum adiponectin concentrations, but this effect was not caused by phospholipid-curcumin complex.

Curcumin supplementation increased serum adiponectin concentrations, but this effect was not caused by phospholipid-curcumin complex.  MP: Red pepper spice (RP) and turmeric (TM) are used as flavorings in foods and for medicinal purposes. Utilizing a randomized, doubled-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design (2-week washout), 4-week supplementation with RP (1 g/d) or TM (2.8 g/d) was tested for influences on inflammation and oxidative stress in 62 overweight/obese (body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2) females (40–75 years) with systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP ≥ 2 mg/l). Overnight, fasted blood samples were collected pre- and post-supplementation, and analyzed for oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes, oxidized low density lipoprotein), inflammation (CRP and seven inflammatory cytokines), and metabolic profiles using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry with multivariate partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Pre- to post-supplementation measures of inflammation and oxidative stress for both RP and TM did not differ when compared to placebo (all interaction effects, P > 0.05), and global metabolic difference scores calculated through PLS-DA were non-significant (both spices, Q2Y < 0.40). These data indicate that 4-week supplementation with RP or TM at culinary levels does not alter oxidative stress or inflammation in overweight/obese females with systemic inflammation, or cause a significant shift in the global metabolic profile.  MP: Background Dietary phytosterols (PS) are well-known hypocholesterolaemic agents. Curcumin elicits hypolipidaemic and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical studies, however, consistent findings in humans are lacking.  Objective Concurrent PS and curcumin supplementation may exhibit enhanced hypocholesterolaemic and anti-inflammatory effects to optimise cardio-protection. The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention with PS with or without curcumin on blood lipids (primary outcome) in hypercholesterolaemic individuals.  Methods A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial trial was conducted in hypercholesterolaemic individuals. Participants received either placebo (PL, no phytosterols or curcumin), phytosterols (PS, 2 g/d), curcumin (CC, 200 mg/d) or a combination of PS and curcumin (PS-CC, 2 g/d–200 mg/d respectively) for four weeks. Primary outcomes included fasting total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), TC-to-HDL-C ratio (TC:HDL-C). Secondary outcomes included anthropometrics and fasting blood glucose concentrations.  Results Seventy participants with a mean (±SEM) fasting TC concentration of 6.57 ± 0.13 mmol/L completed the study (PL, n = 18; PS, n = 17; CC, n = 18; PS-CC, n = 17). PS and PS-CC supplementation significantly lowered TC, LDL-cholesterol and TC:HDL-C post-intervention (p < 0.05). Reductions from baseline in the PS group were 4.8% and 8.1% for TC and LDL-cholesterol respectively (p < 0.05). CC exhibited non-significant reduction (2.3% and 2.6%) in TC and LDL-C respectively, however, the PS-CC resulted in a greater reduction in TC (11.0%) and LDL-cholesterol (14.4%) than either of the treatments alone (p < 0.0001). The reduction in the PS-CC treatment was significantly greater compared to those for CC (p < 0.05) or PL (p < 0.01) alone. Plasma HDL-cholesterol and TG concentrations remained unchanged across all groups. No adverse side effects were reported.  Conclusions The addition of curcumin to phytosterol therapy provides a complementary cholesterol-lowering effect that is larger than phytosterol therapy alone. Implications of these findings include the development of a single functional food containing both the active ingredients for enhanced lipid-lowering and compliance in hypercholesterolaemic individuals.  MP: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health problem. Although many aspects of NAFLD pathogenesis have been understood, there is a paucity of effective treatments to be used as the second line when lifestyle modification is insufficient. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol from turmeric, has been shown to be effective against development of hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis, yet these beneficial effects have not been explored in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on hepatic fat content as well as biochemical and anthropometric features of patients with NAFLD. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients with ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive an amorphous dispersion curcumin formulation (500 mg/day equivalent to 70-mg curcumin) or matched placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Liver fat content (assessed through ultrasonography), glycemic and lipid profile, transaminase levels, and anthropometric indices were evaluated at baseline and at the end of follow-up period. The clinical trial protocol was registered under the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ID: IRCT2014110511763N18. Compared with placebo, curcumin was associated with a significant reduction in liver fat content (78.9% improvement in the curcumin vs 27.5% improvement in the placebo group). There were also significant reductions in body mass index and serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin compared with the placebo group. Curcumin was safe and well tolerated during the course of trial. Findings of the present proof-of-concept trial suggested improvement of different features of NAFLD after a short-term supplementation with curcumin.  MP: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic diseases in the general adult population. Dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and insulin resistance are common risk factors and accompanying features of NAFLD. Curcumin is a dietary natural product with beneficial metabolic effects relevant to the treatment of NAFLD. Aim: To assess the effects of curcumin on metabolic profile in subjects with NAFLD. Methods: Patients diagnosed with NAFLD (grades 1-3; according to liver sonography) were randomly assigned to curcumin (1000 mg/d in 2 divided doses) (n = 50) or control (n = 52) group for a period of 8 weeks. All patients received dietary and lifestyle advises before the start of trial. Anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and uric acid concentrations were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of follow-up. Results: Eighty-seven subjects (n = 44 and 43 in the curcumin and control group, respectively) completed the trial. Supplementation with curcumin was associated with a reduction in serum levels of total cholesterol (P <0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P <0.001), triglycerides (P <0.001), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P <0.001), and uric acid (P <0.001), whereas serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glucose control parameters remained unaltered. Curcumin was safe and well tolerated during this study. Conclusion: Results of the present trial suggest that curcumin supplementation reduces serum lipids and uric acid concentrations in patients with NAFLD.   MP: Objective: Insulin and leptin resistance are important risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is limited evidence regarding the effects of turmeric on NAFLD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of turmeric supplementation on glycemic status and serum leptin levels in patients with NAFLD.  Methods: This double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 46 patients with NAFLD (21males and 25 females) aged 20–60 years old and body mass index (BMI) between 24.9 and 40 kg/m2. The turmeric group (n = 23) was given six turmeric capsules daily for 12 weeks. Each capsule contained 500 mg turmeric powder (6×500 mg). The placebo group (n = 23) was given six placebo capsules daily for the same period. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements, and physical activity levels were collected at the baseline and at the end of the study. Daily dietary intakes also were obtained throughout the study. Data were analyzed by independent t test, paired t test and analysis of covariance.  Results: Turmeric consumption decreased serum levels of glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and leptin (by 1.22, 17.69, 19.48 and 21.33% respectively, p < 0.05 for all) over 12 weeks compared with those variables in the placebo group. Changes in weight, BMI and liver enzymes were not significant compared to the placebo group.  Conclusions: Turmeric supplementation improved glucose indexes and serum leptin levels and may be useful in the control of NAFLD complications.  MP: OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of curcumin in delaying development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the prediabetic population.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled trial included subjects (n = 240) with criteria of prediabetes. All subjects were randomly assigned to receive either curcumin or placebo capsules for 9 months. To assess the T2DM progression after curcumin treatments and to determine the number of subjects progressing to T2DM, changes in β-cell functions (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]-β, C-peptide, and proinsulin/insulin), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), anti-inflammatory cytokine (adiponectin), and other parameters were monitored at the baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 9-month visits during the course of intervention.  RESULTS After 9 months of treatment, 16.4% of subjects in the placebo group were diagnosed with T2DM, whereas none were diagnosed with T2DM in the curcumin-treated group. In addition, the curcumin-treated group showed a better overall function of β-cells, with higher HOMA-β (61.58 vs. 48.72; P < 0.01) and lower C-peptide (1.7 vs. 2.17; P < 0.05). The curcumin-treated group showed a lower level of HOMA-IR (3.22 vs. 4.04; P < 0.001) and higher adiponectin (22.46 vs. 18.45; P < 0.05) when compared with the placebo group.  CONCLUSIONS A 9-month curcumin intervention in a prediabetic population significantly lowered the number of prediabetic individuals who eventually developed T2DM. In addition, the curcumin treatment appeared to improve overall function of β-cells, with very minor adverse effects. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the curcumin intervention in a prediabetic population may be beneficial.  MP: "
"The real-world implementation of heart failure (HF) guidelines remains unclear. Our present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the rate of HF patients receiving guideline-directed treatment to identify the proportion of under-treatment patients and those who are treated with optimal doses, to evaluate the correlation of under-treatment patients' characteristics with the prescribed therapy, and finally, to evaluate the combined effect of the above on incidental mortality and rehospitalization. We conducted a systematic review of the literature indexed in Medline. We screened 1224 papers and excluded 1166 as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 58 papers, which were evaluated by studying the full text, 11 papers that referred to 45866 patients were finally studied in this work. Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II-Receptor Blocker (ARB) use was estimated to be 80.9% (95% CI: 73.9%, 86.4%), β-blockers’ use was 78% (95% CI: 70.4%, 84.1%), Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists' use was 47.4% (95% Cl 41.6%, 53.4%), and cardiac resynchronization therapy's use was 5.8% (95% Cl 3.4%, 9.6%). Meta-regression analysis showed that prescription of more than the half of target dose of ACEI/ARBs was found to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality (Z = −3.61, P = 0.0003), while the relationship with β-blockers was borderline (Z = −1.56, P = 0.11). A satisfactory adherence to the prescription of guideline-recommended treatment in patients with HF was observed. However, the under titration of the life-saving HF drugs need to be improved as only ultimate adherence to guideline-directed treatments may lead to the reduction of HF burden.","MP: The objectives of the present study were to describe epidemiology and outcomes in ambulatory heart failure (HF) patients stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and to identify predictors for mortality at 1 year in each group.  Methods and results The European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Long-Term Registry is a prospective, observational study collecting epidemiological information and 1-year follow-up data in 9134 HF patients. Patients were classified according to baseline LVEF into HF with reduced EF [EF <40% (HFrEF)], mid-range EF [EF 40–50% (HFmrEF)] and preserved EF [EF >50% (HFpEF)]. In comparison with HFpEF subjects, patients with HFrEF were younger (64 years vs. 69 years), more commonly male (78% vs. 52%), more likely to have an ischaemic aetiology (49% vs. 24%) and left bundle branch block (24% vs. 9%), but less likely to have hypertension (56% vs. 67%) or atrial fibrillation (18% vs. 32%). The HFmrEF group resembled the HFrEF group in some features, including age, gender and ischaemic aetiology, but had less left ventricular and atrial dilation. Mortality at 1 year differed significantly between HFrEF and HFpEF (8.8% vs. 6.3%); HFmrEF patients experienced intermediate rates (7.6%). Age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV status and chronic kidney disease predicted mortality in all LVEF groups. Low systolic blood pressure and high heart rate were predictors for mortality in HFrEF and HFmrEF. A lower body mass index was independently associated with mortality in HFrEF and HFpEF patients. Atrial fibrillation predicted mortality in HFpEF patients.  Conclusions Heart failure patients stratified according to different categories of LVEF represent diverse phenotypes of demography, clinical presentation, aetiology and outcomes at 1 year. Differences in predictors for mortality might improve risk stratification and management goals.  MP: Background Data comparing outcomes in heart failure (HF) across Asia are limited. We examined regional variation in mortality among patients with HF enrolled in the ASIAN‐HF (Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure) registry with separate analyses for those with reduced ejection fraction (EF; <40%) versus preserved EF (≥50%).  Methods and Results The ASIAN‐HF registry is a prospective longitudinal study. Participants with symptomatic HF were recruited from 46 secondary care centers in 3 Asian regions: South Asia (India), Southeast Asia (Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore), and Northeast Asia (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China). Overall, 6480 patients aged >18 years with symptomatic HF were recruited (mean age: 61.6±13.3 years; 27% women; 81% with HF and reduced rEF). The primary outcome was 1‐year all‐cause mortality. Striking regional variations in baseline characteristics and outcomes were observed. Regardless of HF type, Southeast Asians had the highest burden of comorbidities, particularly diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, despite being younger than Northeast Asian participants. One‐year, crude, all‐cause mortality for the whole population was 9.6%, higher in patients with HF and reduced EF (10.6%) than in those with HF and preserved EF (5.4%). One‐year, all‐cause mortality was significantly higher in Southeast Asian patients (13.0%), compared with South Asian (7.5%) and Northeast Asian patients (7.4%; P<0.001). Well‐known predictors of death accounted for only 44.2% of the variation in risk of mortality.  Conclusions This first multinational prospective study shows that the outcomes in Asian patients with both HF and reduced or preserved EF are poor overall and worst in Southeast Asian patients. Region‐specific risk factors and gaps in guideline‐directed therapy should be addressed to potentially improve outcomes  MP: Background Physicians' adherence to guideline-recommended therapy is associated with short-term clinical outcomes in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, its impact on longer-term outcomes is poorly documented. Here, we present results from the 18-month follow-up of the QUALIFY registry.  Methods and results Data at 18 months were available for 6118 ambulatory HFrEF patients from this international prospective observational survey. Adherence was measured as a continuous variable, ranging from 0 to 1, and was assessed for five classes of recommended HF medications and dosages. Most deaths were cardiovascular (CV) (228/394) and HF-related (191/394) and the same was true for unplanned hospitalizations (1175 CV and 861 HF-related hospitalizations, out of a total of 1541). According to univariable analysis, CV and HF deaths were significantly associated with physician adherence to guidelines. In multivariable analysis, HF death was associated with adherence level [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87–0.99 per 0.1 unit adherence level increase; P = 0.034] as was composite of HF hospitalization or CV death (SHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99 per 0.1 unit adherence level increase; P = 0.043), whereas unplanned all-cause, CV or HF hospitalizations were not (all-cause: SHR 0.99, 95% CI 0.9–1.02; CV: SHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–1.01; and HF: SHR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.02 per 0.1 unit change in adherence score; P = 0.52, P = 0.2, and P = 0.4, respectively).  Conclusion These results suggest that physicians' adherence to guideline-recommended HF therapies is associated with improved outcomes in HFrEF. Practical strategies should be established to improve physicians' adherence to guidelines.  MP: Background Heart failure (HF) is a global health problem. Guidelines for the management of HF have been established in Western countries and in Taiwan. However, data from the Taiwan Society of Cardiology-Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (TSOC-HFrEF) registry showed suboptimal prescription of guideline-recommended medications. We aimed to analyze the reason of non-prescription and clinical outcomes as a result of under-prescription of medications.  Methods A total of 1509 patients hospitalized for acute HFrEF were recruited in 21 hospitals in Taiwan by the end of October 2014. Prescribed guideline-recommended medications and other relevant clinical parameters were collected and analyzed at discharge and 1 year after index hospitalization.  Results At discharge, 62% of patients were prescribed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB); 60% were prescribed with beta-blockers and 49% were prescribed with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). The proportions of patients at ≥50% of the target dose for ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers and MRA were 24.4%, 20.6%, 86.2%, respectively. At 1-year follow-up, dosages of ACEI/ARB and MRA were up-titrated in about one-fourth patients, and dosages of beta-blocker were up-titrated in about 40% patients. One-year mortality rate was lowest in patients who received at least 2 classes of guideline-recommended medications with ≥50% of the target dose, and highest in those who received 0 or 1 class of medications.  Conclusion The TSOC-HFrEF registry demonstrated the under-prescription of guideline-recommended medications and reluctance of physicians to up-titrate medications to target dose. Action plan needs be formulated in order to improve physician's adherence to HF guidelines.  MP: Introduction: Heart failure (HF) is a medical condition with a rapidly increasing incidence both in Taiwan and worldwide. The objective of the TSOC-HFrEF registry was to assess epidemiology, etiology, clinical management, and outcomes in a large sample of hospitalized patients presenting with acute decompensated systolic HF. Methods: The TSOC-HFrEF registry was a prospective, multicenter, observational survey of patients presenting to 21 medical centers or teaching hospitals in Taiwan. Hospitalized patients with either acute new-onset HF or acute decompensation of chronic HFrEF were enrolled. Data including demographic characteristics, medical history, primary etiology of HF, precipitating factors for HF hospitalization, presenting symptoms and signs, diagnostic and treatment procedures, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and dischargemedications,were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 1509 patients were enrolled into the registry by the end of October 2014, with a mean age of 64 years (72% were male). Ischemic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy were diagnosed in 44% and 33% of patients, respectively. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency were the common comorbid conditions. Acute coronary syndrome, non-compliant to treatment, and concurrent infection were themajor precipitating factors for acute decompensation. The median length of hospital stay was 8 days, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 2.4%. At discharge, 62% of patients were prescribed either angiotensinconverting enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, 60% were prescribed beta-blockers, and 49% were prescribed mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Conclusions: The TSOC-HFrEF registry provided important insights into the current clinical characteristics and management of hospitalized decompensated systolic HF patients in Taiwan. One important observation was that adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy was suboptimal.  MP: Background Heart failure (HF) is a global health problem.

One important observation was that adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy was suboptimal.  MP: Aims The primary objective of the new ESC-HF Pilot Survey was to describe the clinical epidemiology of outpatients and inpatients with heart failure (HF) and the diagnostic/therapeutic processes applied across 12 participating European countries. This pilot study was specifically aimed at validating the structure, performance, and quality of the data set, for continuing the survey into a permanent registry.  Methods and results The ESC-HF Pilot study is a prospective, multicentre, observational survey conducted in 136 cardiology centres from 12 European countries selected to represent the different health systems and care attitudes across Europe. All outpatients with HF and patients admitted for acute HF were included during the enrolment period (1 day per week for 8 consecutive months). From October 2009 to May 2010, 5118 patients were included in this pilot survey, of which 1892 (37%) were admitted for acute HF and 3226 (63%) for chronic HF. Ischaemic aetiology was reported in about half of the patients. In patients admitted for acute HF, the most frequent clinical profile was decompensated HF (75% of cases), whereas pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock were reported, respectively, in 13.3 and 2.3% of the cases. The total in-hospital mortality rate was 3.8% and was cardiovascular in 90.1% of the cases. Lowest and highest mortality rates were observed in hypertensive HF and in cardiogenic shock, respectively. More than 80% of patients with chronic HF were treated with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers and β-adrenergic blockers. However, target doses of such drugs were reached in one-third to one-fourth of the patients only.  Conclusion The ESC-HF Pilot Survey is an example of the possibility of utilizing an observational methodology to get insights into the current clinical practice in Europe, whose picture will be completed by the 1-year follow-up. Moreover, this study offered the opportunity to refine the organizational structure of a long-term, extended European network.  "
"Objectives To explore the effectiveness of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in undergraduate nursing education.  Design A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiment.  Data sources Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, WANFANG, and CNKI were searched for eligible articles published in English and Chinese until May 28, 2021.  Review methods The Quality Appraisal Check-list for Quantitative Intervention Studies was applied to the quality evaluation. Standard mean differences (SMD) were pooled using a random effects model. The results of the individual and combined intervention effects estimation of was displayed in a forest plot, with weight, SMD, its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), Z-test, p, I2.  Results Thirty-eight studies were included and 37 were analyzed. High-fidelity simulation (HFS) revealed significantly larger effect sizes for knowledge (SMD = 0.89, 95% CI [0.54 to 1.23]), skill (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI [0.69 to 1.17]), collaboration (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI [0.26 to 0.78]), caring (SMD = 1.40, 95% CI [0.23 to 2.58]) and learning interest (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI [0.00 to 2.04]) when compared with other teaching methods. However, no significant difference between HFS and other teaching methods in critical thinking (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI [−1.12 to 1.58]), self-confidence (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI [−0.32 to 0.75]) and learning satisfaction (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI [−0.25 to 1.41]) was shown.  Conclusions High-fidelity simulation (HFS) can more effectively cultivate knowledge, skills, collaboration, caring, and learning interest of undergraduate nursing students. Since the effect of HFS is equivalent to other teaching methods in cultivating undergraduate nursing students' critical thinking, self-confidence and learning satisfaction, nursing educators can choose the most appropriate methods to achieve the intended learning outcomes according to the actual situation.","MP: Objectives: This study is involved in designing high-fidelity simulations reflecting the Korean nursing education environment. In addition, it evaluated the simulations by nursing students' learning outcomes and perceptions of the simulation design features. Design: A quantitative design was used in two separate phases. Settings and participants: For the first phase, five nursing experts participated in verifying the appropriateness of two simulation scenarios that reflected the intended learning objectives. For the second phase, 69 nursing students in the third year of a bachelor's degree at a nursing school participated in evaluating the simulations and were randomized according to their previous course grades. Methods: The first phase verified the two simulation scenarios using a questionnaire. The second phase evaluated students' perceptions of the simulation design, self-confidence, and critical thinking skills using a quasi-experimental post-test design. ANCOVA was used to compare the experimental and control groups, and correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the correlation among them. Results: We created 2 simulation scenarios to integrate cognitive and psychomotor skills according to the learning objectives and clinical environment in Korea. The experimental group had significantly higher scores on self-confidence in the first scenario. The positive correlations between perceptions of the simulation design features, self-confidence, and critical thinking skill scores were statistically significant. Conclusions: Students with a more positive perception of the design features of the simulations had better learning outcomes. Based on this result, simulations need to be designed and implemented with more differentiation in order to be perceived more appropriately by students.   MP: Background The purpose of this quasi-experimental research study was to examine the effect of high-fidelity basic life support (BLS) simulation on knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy of Jordanian nursing students.  Method The experimental group (n = 52) received traditional teaching of BLS (3-hour PowerPoint presentation and demonstration on static manikin in groups of 6 to 7 students) and high-fidelity BLS simulation, while the control group (n = 58) received only traditional teaching of BLS (3-hour PowerPoint presentation and demonstration on static manikin in groups of 6 to 7 students).  Results Neither knowledge acquisition nor knowledge retention showed any significant differences between the groups; however, self-efficacy showed significant differences.  Conclusions Students trained with high-fidelity simulation achieved higher scores in acquired and retained BLS knowledge and higher self-efficacy perception, indicating the value of simulation in improving knowledge and self-efficacy in nursing students. Nursing students must be educated with the most realistic technologies available to improve patients' safety.  MP: Background There is a gap in the literature regarding learning outcomes linked to the use of high-fidelity simulators compared to that of traditional teaching methods.  Aim To examine the effect of using high-fidelity simulators on knowledge and skills acquisition and retention with university students.  Methods A randomized two-arm trial using two different educational approaches on 90 nursing students assigned randomly to two groups was used at two points of time.  Findings The results showed significant differences in favor of the participants in the high-fidelity simulator group on both the acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills over time. However, a significant loss of cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge and skills occurred at 3 months after training in both groups.  Conclusions The findings of this study may assist educators in integrating high-fidelity simulators in education and training. In addition, the findings may help nursing educators to arrange additional cardiopulmonary resuscitation training sessions in order to improve cardiac arrested patients’ outcomes.  Linking Evidence to Action High-fidelity simulation (HFS) provides students with interactive learning experiences in a safe controlled environment. HFS enables teachers to implement critical clinical scenarios, such as cardiac arrest, without risk to patients. Integrating the simulation training into nursing curricula will help to overcome the challenges that face many courses, specifically the shortage of clinical areas for training and the increase in numbers of nursing students.  MP: Background The use of simulation to reproduce the experience of health care settings and its use as a strategy in the teaching of nurses has grown at an unprecedented rate. There is little scientific evidence to examine the differences in satisfaction and gains perceived by the students with the use of medium and high fidelity. Objectives To analyse and benchmark gains and satisfaction perceived by nursing students, according to their participation in medium- and high-fidelity simulated practice. Design Randomized control trial post-test only design with control group. Setting and Participants Students of the 4th year of the Bachelor's Degree in Nursing who performed medium and high-fidelity simulated practice in a Simulation Centre environment. Methods A satisfaction scale and a scale of perceived gains from the simulation were applied to the students who underwent simulated practice in a medium-fidelity environment (control group) and high-fidelity environment (experimental group). Statistical analysis was performed and a significance level of p < 0.05 was established. Results Of the 85 students who participated in the study, the majority were female (92.94%), with an average age of 21.89 years (SD = 2.81 years). Satisfaction is statistically significant in the realism dimension and overall satisfaction. In the gains perceived with the simulation there is a statistically significant difference in the dimension recognition/decision. Conclusion Students are very satisfied with the realism of high-fidelity simulated practice and consider that this helps them more with recognition and decision compared with the medium-fidelity simulation.   MP: Use of a human patient simulator (HPS) as a tool for experiential learning provides a mechanism by which students can participate in clinical decision making, practice skills, and observe outcomes from clinical decisions. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two instructional methods to teach specific nursing education content, acute myocardial infarction, on junior-level nursing students' cognitive skills and confidence. The instructional methods included an interactive approach using the HPS method, compared with traditional classroom lecture. Results of this study suggest that use of a teaching strategy involving the HPS method made a positive difference in the nursing students' ability to answer questions on a test of cognitive skills. Confidence levels were not found to be significantly enhanced by use of the HPS method.  MP: Background: Definitive treatment of primary middle ear lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) is not well established owing to the rarity of this disease entity. We report a case of locally advanced primary middle ear LEC treated with concurrent chemoradiation, with good oncologic outcomes. Case presentation: A 46 year-old female of Cantonese (Southern Chinese) descent presented with a four-month history of left sided hearing loss and non-pulsatile tinnitus, associated with progressive ipsilateral facial weakness. She had a left facial palsy (House-Brackmann 2) which then deteriorated to complete palsy over 2 weeks. Otoscopic examination of the left ear revealed a red-hued mass replacing the tympanic membrane. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Fibreoptic nasoendoscopy was unremarkable. Pure tone audiometry revealed profound mixed left hearing loss with type B impedance. Computed tomography of the temporal bone showed an ill-defined left middle ear mass with erosion of the malleus, tegmen tympani and facial canal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed an avidly enhancing lesion involving the dura of the left middle cranial fossa, tympanic and labyrinthine portions of the facial nerve. This mass extended into the apex of the left internal acoustic canal and basal turn of the cochlea. Histopathology confirmed EBV-positive primary middle ear LEC. Concurrent chemoradiation comprising 70Gy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and 3 cycles of concurrent Cisplatin based chemotherapy over a 6 week period was administered. The patient achieved near-complete disease resolution on 3 month post-treatment imaging. Serum EBV DNA titres declined to undetectable levels and the patient is disease-free at 18 months post-diagnosis. Discussion and conclusion: Concurrent chemoradiation with curative intent may be a viable treatment option for locally advanced middle ear LEC not amenable to surgical resection due to expected surgical morbidity. It confers good oncologic outcomes that mimic the response in other head and neck EBV-related lymphoepithelial carcinomas.  MP: With the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease, virtual reality simulation (vSim) has emerged as a simulation educational method. The purpose of this study is to examine the learning effects of vSim by comparing three different educational modalities of nursing care for children with asthma. A quasi-experimental design with three different teaching methods, vSim, high-fidelity simulation (HFS), and vSim with HFS, were used in the study. The group using vSim with HFS showed the highest scores in knowledge, confidence in practice, and performance compared to groups using vSim or HFS alone. Simulation practice using vSim combined with HFS could be an effective educational method for nursing students.  MP: Aim: This paper describes a study that measured and compared knowledge acquisition in nursing students exposed to medium or high fidelity human patient simulation manikins. Background: In Australia and internationally the use of simulated learning environments has escalated. Simulation requires a significant investment of time and money and in a period of economic rationalisation this investment must be justified. Assessment of knowledge acquisition with multiple choice questions is the most common approach used to determine the effectiveness of simulation experiences. Method: This study was conducted in an Australian school of nursing; 84 third year nursing students participated. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of the level of manikin fidelity on knowledge acquisition. Data were collected at three points in time: prior to the simulation, immediately following and two weeks later. Results: Differences in mean scores between the control (medium fidelity) and experimental (high fidelity) groups for Tests 1, 2 and 3 were calculated using independent t tests and were not statistically significant. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to determine whether changes in knowledge scores occurred over time and, while an improvement in scores was observed, it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The results of this study raise questions about the value of investing in expensive simulation modalities when the increased costs associated with high fidelity manikins may not be justified by a concomitant increase learning outcomes. This study also suggests that multiple choice questions may not be the most appropriate measure of simulation effectiveness.  MP: As a key cellular transcription factor that plays a central role in cellular responses to a broad range of stress factors, p53 has generally been considered as a host cell restriction factor for various viral infections. However, the defined roles of p53 in pseudorabies virus (PRV) replication, pathogenesis, and host responses remain unclear. In the present study, we initially constructed a p53 overexpressing a porcine kidney epithelial cell line (PK-15) to detect the effect of p53 on PRV replication in vitro. The results show that viral glycoprotein B (gB) gene copies and the titers of virus were significantly higher in p53 overexpressing PK-15 cells than in PK-15 and p53 inhibitor treated p53 overexpressing PK-15 cells. A similar result was also found in the p53 inhibitor PFT-α-treated PK-15 cells. We then examined the effects of p53 on PRV infection in vivo by using p53-knockout (p53 -/- ) mice. The results show that p53 knockout not only led to significantly reduced rates of mortality but also to reduced viral replication and development of viral encephalitis in the brains of mice following intracranial inoculation. Furthermore, we examined the effect of p53 knockout on the expression of the reported host cell regulators of PRV replication in the brains of mice by using RNA sequencing. The results show that p53 knockout downregulated the interferon (IFN) regulator genes, chemokine genes, and antiviral genes after PRV infection. This finding suggests that p53 positively regulates viral replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These findings offer novel targets of intrinsic host cell immunity for PRV infection.  MP: Online medical team is an emerging online medical model in which patients can choose a doctor to register and consult. A doctor’s reputation cannot be ignored. It is worth studying how that online reputation affects the focal doctor’s appointment numbers on the online medical team. Based on the online reputation mechanism and social interdependence theory, this study empirically studied the impact of the focal doctor’s own reputation and other teammates’ reputation on his/her appointment numbers. Our data include 31,143 doctors from 6103 online expert teams of Guahao.com. The results indicate that for a leader doctor, his/her appointment numbers are not related to his/her own reputation, and there was an inverted U-shaped relationship with the ordinary doctors’ reputations on the team. For an ordinary doctor, his/her appointment numbers were positively correlated with his/her own reputation and positively correlated with his/her leader’s reputation and there was an inverted U-shaped relationship with the other ordinary doctors’ reputations. The research showed that there is a positive spillover effect on the team leader’s reputation. There are two relationships between team doctors: competition and cooperation. This study provides guidance for the leader to select team members and the ordinary doctor to select a team.  MP: Background: The conventional superposition methods use an ordinary least squares (LS) fit for structural comparison of two different conformations of the same protein. The main problem of the LS fit that it is sensitive to outliers, i.e. large displacements of the original structures superimposed. Results: To overcome this problem, we present a new algorithm to overlap two protein conformations by their atomic coordinates using a robust statistics technique: least median of squares (LMS). In order to effectively approximate the LMS optimization, the forward search technique is utilized. Our algorithm can automatically detect and superimpose the rigid core regions of two conformations with small or large displacements. In contrast, most existing superposition techniques strongly depend on the initial LS estimating for the entire atom sets of proteins. They may fail on structural superposition of two conformations with large displacements. The presented LMS fit can be considered as an alternative and complementary tool for structural superposition. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is robust and does not require any prior knowledge of the flexible regions. Furthermore, we show that the LMS fit can be extended to multiple level superposition between two conformations with several rigid domains. Our fit tool has produced successful superpositions when applied to proteins for which two conformations are known. The binary executable program for Windows platform, tested examples, and database are available from https://engineering.purdue.edu/PRECISE/LMSfit.

MP: Background: Traditional clinical experiences are being supplemented with high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in many nursing programs. The immediate and long-term impact on students' perception of clinical competence is not known. Method: Surveys were administered to 1st-year nursing students following their first-semester clinical experiences in either a traditional or an HFS setting. Differences between the two groups were compared by analysis of the results of a survey of perceived clinical competence. The comparison was made again for the cohorts following their second-semester hospital-based clinical experiences. Results: Significantly higher scores were reported by the HFS group initially, but this difference was less pronounced following second-semester hospital-based clinical experiences. Conclusions: Students with first-semester HFS experiences had initial higher perceptions of competence. Further research is needed to demonstrate the short- and long-term impact of simulated experiences on perceived competence, as well as on clinical performance.   MP: Background  Improving nursing students' knowledge and clinical judgment related to mechanical ventilation (MV) is paramount, considering the heightened need for MV due to the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. High-fidelity simulation (HFS) provides students with real-life clinical experiences that they would rarely confront in clinical training, especially complex case scenarios (such as a patient needing MV).  Purpose  This study assessed students' clinical knowledge and judgment after including HFS involving MV in an undergraduate nursing program.  Methods  This was a quasi-experimental design with a convenience sample of 151 nursing students using the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric.  Results  There were significant differences between the intervention and control groups in knowledge (t = 20.42; P = .001) and total clinical judgment scores (t = 19.55; P < .001) post-HFS.  Conclusions  Including a complex case study using MV and HFS significantly improved students' clinical decision-making, clinical knowledge, and self-confidence and enhanced their critical thinking, noticing, interpreting, reflecting, and responding capabilities.  MP: BACKGROUND: High-fidelity simulation (HFS) as a teaching-learning method has increased, especially in medical programs. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of using HFS on the satisfaction, self-confidence, self-efficacy, and knowledge of undergraduate students in oncology care. METHODS: A pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design was utilized. Random sampling technique was used to recruit the participants. The scenarios including septic shock and infusion reaction were implemented. The training program including lectures and the simulation was run in a high fidelity simulation lab. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (t=-5.95, p= 0.001) between the experimental group (M= 13.95, S D= 3.35) and the control group (M= 6.25, SD= 2.65) regarding knowledge, confidence (t=-22.75, p= 0.001) between the experimental group (M= 61.25, SD= 12.10) and the control group (M= 38.50, SD= 6.20), satisfaction level t=-18.25, p= 0.001; experimental group-M= 42.25, SD= 4.25; and control group-M= 28.50, SD= 3.15), and there was a significant difference between the experimental group (M= 35.50, SD= 3.25) and control group (M= 24.25, SD= 2.85) regarding self-efficacy (t=-13.25, p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High-fidelity simulation in nursing increased student knowledge, self-confidence, satisfaction, and self-efficacy in managing septic shock and infusion reaction as common oncology emergencies.  MP: In research literature, the concept of critical thinking has been widely utilized in nursing education. However, critical thinking has been defined and evaluated using a variety of methods. This paper presents a concept analysis to define and clarify the concept of critical thinking to provide a deeper understanding of how critical thinking can be incorporated into nursing education through the use of simulation exercises. A theoretical definition and sample cases were developed to illuminate the concept as well as a discussion of the antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents of critical thinking.  MP: Due to the increasing focus on simulation used in nursing education, there is a need to examine how the scenarios and different simulation methods used are perceived by students. The aim of this study was to examine nursing students' perceptions of scenarios played out in different simulation methods, and whether their educational level influenced their perception. The study had a quantitative, evaluative and comparative design. The sample consisted of baccalaureate nursing students (n=86) within various educational levels. The students were randomly divided into groups. They solved a patient case adapted to their educational level by using a high-fidelity patient simulator, a static mannequin or a paper/pencil case study. Data were collected by three instruments developed by the National League for Nursing. The results showed that the nursing students reported satisfaction with the implementation of the scenarios regardless of the simulation methods used. The findings indicated that the students who used the paper/pencil case study were the most satisfied. Moreover, educational level did not seem to influence their perceptions. Conclusions: Independent of educational level, the findings indicated that simulation with various degrees of fidelity could be used in nursing education. There is a need for further research to examine more closely the rationale behind the students' perception of the simulation methods.   MP: The superoxide-generating activity of Nox5 is regulated by Ca2+ flux, primarily through its self-contained calcium binding domain (EFD). Upon Ca2+ binding, Nox5’s EFD undergoes a conformational change that exposes its buried hydrophobic residues. Previously, we determined the Ca2+ binding constants of the N-terminal half domain (N-EFD). Here we performed a similar characterization with its C-terminal lobe (C-EFD). Our studies revealed that the binding affinities (Ka’s) of the EFD are in the range of 108–105 M−1 with a strong Ca2+ binding that occurs in the C-EFD. The 3rd Ca2+ binding site also binds Mg2+ (Ka = 4.53 × 103 M−1), where its high Ca2+ binding affinity becomes moderate in cellular conditions. The essential hydrophobic exposure upon metal binding was assessed with the analysis of the 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) interaction via fluorescence and calorimetry. While the ANS fluorescence and binding studies agree with each other in general, the results do not correlate to the actual hydrophobic exposure content. The heat capacity change (ΔCp) of Ca2+ binding for EFD is −24.1 cal/mol.K, while those of N-EFD and C-EFD are −56.3 and −41.6 cal/mol·K, respectively, indicating.  MP: Crowding is often described as an important environmental factor in consumers' evaluations of service experiences. Prior research identifies that crowding is significantly influence with customers' in-store purchases such as the customer satisfaction, purchase intention, and purchase number. However, the retailing literature are still lacks directly empirical studies about how the crowding influence customer in-store behaviors which effect these in-store purchases, such as the customer crowding adaptation strategies. In this study, we focus on a shop area's visit ratio to describe the customers' crowding adaptation strategies, and try to investigate how crowding effect on the customers' adaptation strategies in an area level by analyzing the RFID-based Path data and matched POS data which collected from a Japanese supermarket. According to the regress analysis, the result shown the linear correlativity between these variables is prominent, which means increasing a shop area's crowding situation can actually help retailers to attract more customers to visit that area. The finding can further provide guidelines for retailers' crowd management or design of public spaces in store.  MP:"
"Objective Hyperemesis gravidarum is characterized by severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, frequently resulting in severe maternal nutritional deficiency. Maternal undernutrition is associated with adverse offspring health outcomes. Whether hyperemesis gravidarum permanently affects offspring health remains unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal hyperemesis gravidarum on offspring health.  Data Sources MEDLINE and Embase were searched from inception to September 6, 2021.  Study Eligibility Criteria Studies reporting on health at any age beyond the perinatal period of children born to mothers with hyperemesis gravidarum were included.  Methods Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess risk of bias. We conducted a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis where possible. In meta-analyses with high heterogeneity (I2>75%), we did not provide a pooled odds ratio.  Results Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review (n=1,814,785 offspring). Meta-analysis (n=619, 2 studies: 1 among adolescents and 1 among adults) showed that hyperemesis gravidarum was associated with anxiety disorder (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–2.91; I2, 0%) and sleep problems in offspring (odds ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–6.93; I2, 0%). Hyperemesis gravidarum was associated with testicular cancer in male offspring aged up to 40 years on meta-analysis (5 studies, n=20,930 offspring), although heterogeneity was observed on the basis of a wide 95% prediction interval (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–2.39; I2, 0%; 95% prediction interval, 0.83–3.08). All 6 studies reporting on attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and autism spectrum disorder reported an increase among children of mothers with hyperemesis gravidarum in comparison with children of unaffected mothers. Meta-analysis showed high heterogeneity, precluding us from reporting a pooled odds ratio. Most studies reporting on cognitive and motor problems found an increase among hyperemesis gravidarum-exposed children. One study investigated brain structure and found smaller cortical volumes and areas among children from hyperemesis gravidarum-affected pregnancies than among those from unaffected pregnancies. Studies evaluating anthropometry and cardiometabolic disease risk of hyperemesis gravidarum-exposed children had inconsistent findings.  Conclusion Our systematic review showed that maternal hyperemesis gravidarum is associated with small increases in adverse health outcomes among children, including neurodevelopmental disorders, mental health disorders, and possibly testicular cancer, although evidence is based on few studies of low quality.","MP: Objective: To report the weight loss and associated symptoms experienced by a large cohort of women with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).  Methods: Data were obtained from an HG website registry, where women with HG were recruited on-line. Respondents were included if they experienced at least 1 live birth >27 weeks' gestation. Extreme weight loss was defined as a loss of >15% of prepregnancy weight.  Results: Of the 819 women surveyed, 214 (26.1%) met criteria for extreme weight loss. These women were twice as likely to be Hispanic or nonwhite. Extreme weight loss (p < 0.001) was associated with indicators of the severity of HG, such as hospitalization and use of parenteral nutrition, and with multiple symptoms during pregnancy, such as gallbladder and liver dysfunction, renal failure, and retinal hemorrhage. Among all women surveyed, 22.0% reported that symptoms lasted throughout pregnancy; this finding was nearly twice as likely among women with extreme weight Loss: 63 of 214 (29.4%) vs. 117 of 605 (19.3%) (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.2-2.5, p = 0.003). For some women, symptoms continued postpartum and included food aversions, muscle pain, nausea, and posttraumatic stress. Approximately 16% of babies were born prematurely, and 8% reportedly weighed <2500 g. Among women with extreme weight loss, 9.3% reported having a child with a behavioral disorder.  Conclusions: Extreme weight loss is common among women with HG, suggesting that HG is a form of prolonged starvation in pregnancy and that the long-term effects of this condition on women and their offspring warrant further investigation.  MP: Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum alters maternal (and possibly fetal) nutrition throughout pregnancy, but there are no data on long-term effects on offspring metabolism. Thus, we aimed to assess whether severe hyperemesis gravidarum (SHG) affects glucose homeostasis and body composition in the offspring in childhood.  Methods: Healthy prepubertal children (aged 4–11 years) born at term were studied: offspring of mothers who were admitted to hospital with SHG (n = 36) and offspring of mothers from control pregnancies (n = 42). Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured using iv glucose tolerance tests and Bergman's minimal model. Other assessments included lipid and hormonal profiles and body composition using whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.  Results: Insulin sensitivity in SHG children was 20% lower than in controls (8.49 vs 10.60 × 10−4·min−1·(mU/L); P = .014). SHG children also had higher fasting insulin (6.88 vs 5.04 mIU/L; P = .024) and lower IGF binding protein 1 (11.8 vs 19.0 ng/mL; P = .004) concentrations than controls. Baseline cortisol concentrations were 22% higher in SHG offspring (256 vs 210 nmol/L; P = .021). Children in both groups were anthropometrically similar.  Conclusion: Children born to mothers who experienced SHG have lower insulin sensitivity, which may increase their long-term risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Follow-up of SHG offspring is essential to determine later risk of metabolic disease.  MP: In this case-control study of 108 cases of testicular cancer in men under 30 years of age, cryptorchidism was a major risk factor [relative risk (RR)=9.0]. Low birth weight was also associated with increased risk (RR=3.2). Having severe acne at puberty was protective (RR=0.37). Interviews with mothers of cases revealed that exposure of the mother to exogenous estrogen during pregnancy created a significant risk in the son (RR=8.0). In first pregnancies, excessive nausea indicated an increased risk of testicular cancer (RR=4.2). Increased body weight in the mother also increased the risk. The relation between these factors and testicular hypoplasia is discussed. Severe peri menopausal menorrhagia was a factor in the mother associated with reduced risk of testicular cancer in the son (RR=0.1 0). A modified hormonal milieu in the mother appears to be important in the later development of testicular cancer in her sons.  MP: The purpose of this study was to follow up on the reporting of neurodevelopmental disorders in children exposed in utero to Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). This was an exploratory descriptive study whereby neurodevelopmental outcomes of 267 children delivered by 177 mothers with HG were compared to neurodevelopmental outcomes from 93 children delivered by 60 unaffected mothers. Similar to at age 8, the children (now 12) exposed in utero to HG had over 3-fold increase in odds of neurodevelopmental disorders including attention, anxiety, sensory, sleep difficulty, and social development delay/social anxiety. However, with the longer follow-up, there was also a significant increase in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), reported in 22/267 (8%) of children exposed to HG in utero and no unexposed children. As early intervention for ASD can be critical to prognosis, larger studies are urgently needed to determine whether ASD is associated with exposure to HG.  MP: Objective The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of emotional, behavioral, and learning disorders in children exposed in utero to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and to identify prognostic factors for these disorders. Study design Neurodevelopmental outcomes of 312 children from 203 mothers with HG were compared to neurodevelopmental outcomes from 169 children from 89 unaffected mothers. Then the clinical profiles of patients with HG and a normal child outcome were compared to the clinical profiles of patients with HG and a child with neurodevelopmental delay to identify prognostic factors. Binary responses were analyzed using either a Chi-square or Fisher Exact test and continuous responses were analyzed using a t-test. Results Children exposed in utero to HG have a 3.28-fold increase in odds of a neurodevelopmental diagnosis including attention disorders, learning delay, sensory disorders, and speech and language delay (P < 0.0005). Among characteristics of HG pregnancies, only early onset of symptoms (prior to 5 weeks gestation) was significantly linked to neurodevelopmental delay. We found no evidence for increased risk of 13 emotional, behavioral, and learning disorders, including autism, intellectual impairment, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the study was not sufficiently powered to detect rare conditions. Medications, treatments, and preterm birth were not associated with an increased risk for neurodevelopmental delay. Conclusion Women with HG are at a significantly increased risk of having a child with neurodevelopmental delay. Common antiemetic treatments were not linked to neurodevelopmental delay, but early symptoms may play a role. There is an urgent need to address whether aggressive treatment that includes vitamin and nutrient supplementation in women with early symptoms of severe nausea of pregnancy decreases the risk of neurodevelopmental delay.   MP: Objective â€ This study aimed to determine if hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk, and how this association is influenced by race, ethnicity, sex, exposure timing, and medication used to treat it. Study Design â€ This is a retrospective cohort study using records from 469,789 mother-child pairs who delivered at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) hospital (1991-2014). Singleton-born children were followed longitudinally from 2 to 17 years of age. Clinical records were used to determine the diagnosis of HG and specialist-confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Results â€ Children exposed to HG in-utero had higher rates of ASD than unexposed children (2.87 vs. 1.71/1,000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [adj.HR]: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.70). Children exposed at first and second trimester of pregnancies were more likely to develop ASD; 1.58-fold (95% CI: 1.40-1.79), and 1.36-fold (95% CI: 1.05-1.75), respectively, compared with unexposed children. HG was associated with ASD for boys (adj.HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.33-1.70) and girls (adj.HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.28-2.05). HG was significantly associated with ASD risk in white and Hispanic children. The medications used to treat HG did not contribute to ASD risk. Conclusion â€ HG diagnosis is associated with ASD risk and may be helpful in identifying at-risk children who could benefit from enhanced surveillance and earlier diagnosis and intervention.  MP: An individually matched case-control study of testis cancer in 131 men under age 40 was counducted to investigate antecedent risk factors including events during prenatal life. Ten patients were born with an undescended testis compared to only two controls (p = 0.02), a previously reported risk factor. Two new risk factors were uncovered: six patient-mothers received hormones during the Index pregnancy compared to only one control-mother, and eight patient-mothers and two control-mothers reported excessive nausea as a complication of the index pregnancy. A hypothesis linking these three factors is presented: viz. that a major risk factor for testis cancer is a relative excess of certain hormones (in particular estrogen) at the time of differentiation of the testes.  MP: Objective To investigate the long-term consequences of prenatal exposure to maternal hyperemesis gravidarum upon offspring cardiometabolic risk factors.  Design This study is part of the prospective follow-up of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986.  Setting Between 1 July 1985 and 30 June 1986 all pregnant women in two provinces of Finland were recruited at first antenatal visit (99% of eligible participated).  Population A total of 8953 women with liveborn singleton offspring who consented to having their children followed-up were included.  Methods Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) was defined as hospitalisation during pregnancy for HG based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD) code. Women who were not hospitalised for HG during pregnancy were used as a reference group. Data on pregnancy and birth outcomes were obtained via medical records and questionnaires; 6462 adolescents, aged 16 years, underwent anthropometric measurements (HG n = 42, reference n = 6420) and 5648 adolescents had a fasting blood sample taken (HG n = 36, reference n = 5612).  Main outcome measures Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipid levels in offspring.  Results Multivariate regression analyses showed no differences in offspring BMI (kg/m2; adjusted percentage difference HG versus reference, 2.2; 95% CI −0.1, 4.6), systolic blood pressure (adjusted difference 2.1 mmHg; 95% CI −1.5, 5.6), and fasting blood glucose (mmol/l; adjusted percentage difference, 2.3; 95% CI −0.6, 5.4), between adolescents born to mothers with and without HG.  Conclusions We found no evidence that prenatal exposure to HG has negative consequences for cardiometabolic health of offspring at the age of 16 years.  MP: Services and their interfaces are a cornerstone of Web applications. API description formats help developers in accessing and combining service functionalities. The OpenAPI specification has gained considerable popularity over the last years. Existing tools around OpenAPI support the generation of HTML interfaces to mockup requests. While these interfaces are suited well for developers, it remains hard for non-developers to assess service functionalities. To this end, we present the Direwolf Interaction Flow Designer in this demo. It parses OpenAPI documents to generate Web frontends with the help of the Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML).  MP: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, is characterized by long-term maternal stress, undernutrition and dehydration. While maternal stress and malnutrition of pregnancy are linked to poor neonatal outcome and associated with poor adult health, long-term outcome of fetal exposure to HG has never been explored. The purpose of this study is to determine whether long-term emotional and behavioral diagnoses may be associated with fetal exposure to HG. Emotional and behavioral diagnoses of adults born of a pregnancy complicated by HG were compared to diagnoses from non-exposed controls. Offspring exposed to HG in utero were significantly more likely to have a psychological and behavioral disorder (OR = 3.6, P < 0.0001) with diagnoses primarily of depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety. In utero exposure to HG may lead to increased risks of psychological and behavioral disorders in the offspring.   MP: There is evidence that sex hormones and intrauterine factors are involved in the etiology of testicular cancer. We evaluated the importance of perinatal and adult life correlates of sex hormones as risk factors for testicular cancer in a case control study of 97 incident, histologically confirmed cases, residents of the Greater Athens area and environs, who were diagnosed in the 3 specialized cancer hospitals and the major General Hospital in Athens during the 2 year period 1993-94. Cases were age-matched to 2 healthy controls from the same study base. Both cases and controls as well as their mothers were interviewed by the same investigator and the data were analyzed through conditional logistic regression. The odds ratio for testicular cancer was elevated among persons born after a pregnancy characterized by severe nausea. Among the adult life factors, higher body mass was associated with reduced risk, as was evidence of baldness. To the extent that nausea during pregnancy reflects higher levels of pregnancy estrogens on the one hand, and baldness is linked to androgens on the other, our data suggest that estrogens in the intrauterine life and androgens at later stages may have sequential opposing effects for the development of testicular cancer.  MP: Background: Evidence suggests that low birth weight and fetal exposure to extreme maternal undernutrition is associated with cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Hyperemesis gravidarum, a clinical entity characterized by severe nausea and excess vomiting leading to a suboptimal maternal nutritional status during early pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several studies also showed that different measures related to hyperemesis gravidarum, such as maternal daily vomiting or severe weight loss, are associated with increased risks of adverse fetal pregnancy outcomes. Not much is known about long-term offspring consequences of maternal hyperemesis gravidarum and related measures during pregnancy. We examined the associations of maternal daily vomiting during early pregnancy, as a measure related to hyperemesis gravidarum, with childhood cardiovascular risk factors.  Methods: In a population-based prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onwards among 4,769 mothers and their children in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we measured childhood body mass index, total fat mass percentage, android/gynoid fat mass ratio, preperitoneal fat mass area, blood pressure, lipids, and insulin levels. We used multiple regression analyses to assess the associations of maternal vomiting during early pregnancy with childhood cardiovascular outcomes.  Results: Compared with the children of mothers without daily vomiting during early pregnancy, the children of mothers with daily vomiting during early pregnancy had a higher childhood total body fat mass (difference 0.12 standard deviation score [SDS]; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03–0.20), android/gynoid fat mass ratio (difference 0.13 SDS; 95% CI 0.04–0.23), and preperitoneal fat mass area (difference 0.10 SDS; 95% CI 0–0.20). These associations were not explained by birth characteristics but partly explained by higher infant growth. Maternal daily vomiting during early pregnancy was not associated with childhood blood pressure, lipids, and insulin levels.  Conclusions: Maternal daily vomiting during early pregnancy is associated with higher childhood total body fat mass and abdominal fat mass levels, but not with other cardiovascular risk factors. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings, to explore the underlying mechanisms and to assess the long-term consequences.  MP: A case-control study is reported based on 87 deaths from testicular cancer that occurred in children in Great Britain 1953-73. Factors that significantly increased relative risk were tuberculosis of the mother during the index pregnancy and maternal epilepsy; factors that increased risk but not significantly were hyperemesis in the index pregnancy, a maternal history of stillbirths, and hernia and genitourinary defects in the child. Cryptorchidism was not studied. The available evidence suggests that prenatal determinants of testicular cancer in adults are also determinants of testicular cancer in childhood. The incidence and mortality from this disease are not increasing among children in Britain and other countries, whereas there is an increasing trend in young adults in several developed countries. Probably, therefore, the secular increase in the rates of young adult testicular cancer is due to factors that affect adults but not children, the hence are likely to be postnatal.  MP: Background Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects 50 to 80 per cent of women. The existing literature has examined NVP from the perspective of the mother, and relatively less is known about offspring outcomes.  Objectives To study the relationships of NVP with social-emotional, behavioural, and cognitive outcomes of the offspring in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort.  Methods In the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes prospective mother-offspring cohort study, mothers responded to a structured NVP questionnaire at 26-28 weeks’ gestation (n = 1172) and participants with severe NVP were confirmed using medical records. Children underwent multiple neurodevelopmental assessments throughout childhood. We conducted multivariable regressions with post-estimation predictive margins to understand the associations of NVP with offspring neurobehavioural outcomes, which included 1-year Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, 1.5-year Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, 2-year Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 2- and 4-year Child Behavior Checklist, and 4.5-year Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test. Analyses were adjusted for household income, birth variables, maternal mental health, and other relevant medical variables. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated using standardised mean differences (μd).  Results Mothers were categorised into no (n = 296, 25.3%), mild-moderate (n = 686, 58.5%), and severe NVP (n = 190, 16.2%), of whom 67 (5.7%) required admission. Compared to children of mothers who had no or mild-moderate NVP, children with exposure to severe NVP exhibited more externalising behaviours (μd 2.0, 95% CI 0.3, 3.6; Cohen's d = 0.33) and social communication difficulties before 2 years (μd 4.1, 95% Cl 0.1, 8.0; Cohen's d = 0.38), both externalising (μd 1.5, 95% CI 0.4, 2.6; Cohen's d = 0.43) and internalising behaviours at 2 years (μd 1.2, 95% CI 0.1, 2.2; Cohen's d = 0.35), and only internalising behaviours after 2 years (μd 1.1, 95% CI 0.4, 2.0; Cohen's d = 0.37).  MP: Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum is a serious condition affecting 0.8-2.3 % of pregnant women and can be regarded as a restricted period of famine. Research concerning potential long-term consequences of the condition for the offspring, is limited, but lack of nutrition in-utero has been associated with chronic disease in adulthood, including some cancers. There is growing evidence that several forms of cancer may originate during fetal life. We conducted a large study linking the high-quality population-based medical birth- and cancer registries in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, to explore whether hyperemesis is associated with increased cancer risk in offspring. Methods: A registry-based nested case-control study. Twelve types of childhood cancer were selected; leukemia, lymphoma, cancer of the central nervous system, testis, bone, ovary, breast, adrenal and thyroid gland, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma and retinoblastoma. Conditional logistic regression models were applied to study associations between hyperemesis and risk of childhood cancer, both all types combined and separately. Cancer types with five or more exposed cases were stratified by age at diagnosis. All analysis were adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity and smoking, in addition to the offspring's Apgar score, placental weight and birth weight. Relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Results: In total 14,805 cases and approximately ten controls matched on time, country of birth, sex and year of birth per case (147,709) were identified. None of the cancer types, analyzed combined or separately, revealed significant association with hyperemesis. When stratified according to age at diagnosis, we observed a RR 2.13 for lymphoma among adolescents aged 11-20 years ((95 % CI 1.14-3.99), after adjustment for maternal ethnicity and maternal age, RR 2.08 (95 % CI 1.11-3.90)). The finding was not apparent when a stricter level of statistical significance was applied. Conclusions: The main finding of this paper is that hyperemesis does not seem to increase cancer risk in offspring. The positive association to lymphoma may be by chance and needs confirmation.  MP: Background Two studies have suggested that severe prolonged nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is associated with emotional and behavioral problems in offspring, with smaller sample size and short-term follow-up. Moreover, little information is available on the role of the brain structure in the associations.  Methods In a US-based cohort, the association was investigated between severe prolonged nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (extending after the second trimester and termed SNVP), psychiatric and cognitive problems, and brain morphology, from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, from 10,710 children aged 9–11 years. We validated the emotional including psychiatric findings using the Danish National Cohort Study with 2,092,897 participants.  Results SNVP was significantly associated with emotional and psychiatric problems (t = 8.89, Cohen’s d = 0.172, p = 6.9 × 10−19) and reduced global cognitive performance (t = − 4.34, d = − 0.085, p = 1.4 × 10−5) in children. SNVP was associated with low cortical area and volume, especially in the cingulate cortex, precuneus, and superior medial prefrontal cortex. These lower cortical areas and volumes significantly mediated the relation between SNVP and the psychiatric and cognitive problems in children. In the Danish National Cohort, severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risks of behavioral and emotional disorders in children (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.33).  Conclusions SNVP is strongly associated with psychiatric and cognitive problems in children, with mediation by brain structure. These associations highlight the clinical importance and potential benefits of the treatment of SNVP, which could reduce the risk of psychiatric disorder in the next generation.  MP:"
"Purpose The aim of this review was to systematically collect the published evidence to assess the effect of recreational physical activity (PA) in reducing breast cancer (BC) recurrence in female survivors.  Methods A bibliographic search was carried out in PubMed Medline, CINAHL Complete, Scopus and Lilacs until June 2021. We selected observational studies or clinical trials comprising women diagnosed with BC, in which the risk of recurrence of BC was measured before or after performing recreational PA. As a secondary outcome, we analyzed disease free survival for recurrence/disease-specific mortality. The methodological quality of observational studies was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and clinical trials with the PEDro scale. A random effects model was used to estimate the relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) to infer the results for any female survivor of BC. We performed separate meta-analyses for prediagnosis and postdiagnosis recreational PA.  Results Eleven studies were included, providing data from 29,677 surviving women with BC with an age range of 18–79 years old. Postdiagnosis recreational PA reduced the risk of BC recurrence by 16% (RR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.91) and the risk of recurrence/disease-specific mortality by 23% (RR, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.93). Prediagnosis PA reduced the risk of BC by 18% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.91).  Conclusion This systematic review with meta-analysis shows that recreational PA can be an interesting therapeutic tool to protect against recurrence of BC in female survivors.","MP: Background: Very little is known about the effect of modifiable lifestyle factors on outcomes of triple-negative breast cancer. We examined this association in a population-based prospective cohort study of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: A total of 518 women with confirmed triple-negative breast cancer, recruited by the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, completed 6-, 18-, 36-, and 60-month postdiagnosis surveys. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the associations. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 53.4 (standard deviation = 10.6) years old. After a median follow-up of 9.1 years (range: 0.6- 11.8), 128 deaths and 112 recurrences were documented. Exercise during the first 60 months postdiagnosis was inversely associated with total mortality and recurrence/disease-specific mortality with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.46, 0.96) and 0.58 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.86), respectively. Women with higher exercise-metabolic equivalent scores (≥7.6 metabolic equivalent-hours/week) and longer duration of exercise (≥2.5 hours/ week) had lower risk of total and recurrence/disease-specific mortality than did nonexercisers. Compared with nontea drinkers, survival was better among women who were regular tea drinkers during the first 60 months for all cause (HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.93) and recurrence/disease-specific mortality (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31, 0.96). There was no dose-response pattern for tea consumption. No interactions were observed for body mass index, menopausal status, and comorbidity. Conclusions: These findings show that postdiagnosis exercise and tea intake were associated with improved survival among women with triple-negative breast cancer.   MP: Objective Research suggests that physical activity is associated with improved breast cancer survival, yet no studies have examined the association between post-diagnosis changes in physical activity and breast cancer outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether baseline activity and 1-year change in activity are associated with breast cancer events or mortality. Methods A total of 2,361 post-treatment breast cancer survivors (Stage I-III) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of dietary change completed physical activity measures at baseline and one year. Physical activity variables (total, moderate-vigorous, and adherence to guidelines) were calculated for each time point. Median follow-up was 7.1 years. Outcomes were invasive breast cancer events and all-cause mortality. Results Those who were most active at baseline had a 53% lower mortality risk compared to the least active women (HR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.84; p = .01). Adherence to activity guidelines was associated with a 35% lower mortality risk (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p<.01). Neither baseline nor 1-year change in activity was associated with additional breast cancer events. Conclusions Higher baseline (post-treatment) physical activity was associated with improved survival. However, change in activity over the following year was not associated with outcomes. These data suggest that long-term physical activity levels are important for breast cancer prognosis.  MP: It has been suggested that exercise following breast cancer diagnosis is inversely associated with mortality. However, controversy exists regarding the causality of such associations. We evaluated associations of exercise after breast cancer diagnosis with total mortality and recurrence/disease-specific mortality, accounting for conditions that restrict exercise participation. The analysis included 4,826 women with stage I to III breast cancer identified 6 months after diagnosis through the population-based Shanghai Cancer Registry and recruited into the study between 2002 and 2006. Exercise was assessed approximately 6, 18, and 36 months postdiagnosis, and metabolic equivalent (MET) scores were derived. Information on medical history, cancer diagnosis, treatments, quality of life (QOL), anthropometrics, and lifestyles were obtained by in-person interviews at 6 months postdiagnosis. Medical charts were abstracted to verify clinical information. During the median follow-up of 4.3 years, 436 deaths and 450 recurrences/cancerrelated deaths were documented. After adjustment for QOL, clinical prognostic factors, and other covariates, exercise during the first 36 months postdiagnosis was inversely associated with total mortality and recurrence/disease-specific mortality with HRs of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56-0.88) and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.47-0.76), respectively. Significant dose-response relationships between total and recurrence/diseasespecific mortality rates and exercise duration and MET scores were observed (all values for P trend < 0.05). The exercise-mortality associations were not modified by menopausal status, comorbidity, QOL, or body size assessed at approximately 6 months postdiagnosis. An interaction between disease stage and hormone receptor status and total mortality was noted. Our study suggests that exercise after breast cancer diagnosis may improve overall and disease-free survival.  MP: Observational studies suggest that physical activity after a breast cancer diagnosis is associated with improved cancer outcomes; however, no randomized data are available. Here, we report an exploratory follow-up of cancer outcomes from the Supervised Trial of Aerobic versus Resistance Training (START). METHODS: The START was a Canadian multicenter trial that randomized 242 breast cancer patients between 2003 and 2005 to usual care (n = 82), supervised aerobic (n = 78), or resistance (n = 82) exercise during chemotherapy. The primary end point for this exploratory analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points were overall survival, distant DFS, and recurrence-free interval. The two exercise arms were combined for analysis (n = 160), and selected subgroups were explored. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 89 months, there were 25/160 (15.6%) DFS events in the exercise groups and 18/82 (22.0%) in the control group. Eight-year DFS was 82.7% for the exercise groups compared with 75.6% for the control group (HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-1.24; log-rank, P = 0.21). Slightly stronger effects were observed for overall survival (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.27-1.33; log-rank, P = 0.21), distant DFS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.32-1.19; log-rank, P = 0.15), and recurrence-free interval (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.30-1.11; Gray test, P = 0.095). Subgroup analyses suggested potentially stronger exercise effects on DFS for women who were overweight/obese (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.27-1.27), had stage II/III cancer (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.31-1.20), estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.26-1.29), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.02), received taxane-based chemotherapies (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.19-1.15), and â‰1 85% of their planned chemotherapy (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory follow-up of the START provides the first randomized data to suggest that adding exercise to standard chemotherapy may improve breast cancer outcomes. A definitive phase III trial is warranted.   MP: Few studies have examined the association between physical activity and disease outcomes in breast cancer survivors. Here, we report the association between lifetime total physical activity performed prior to diagnosis and disease outcomes in a population-based sample of breast cancer survivors. A cohort of 1,231 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 1997 was followed for a minimum of 8.3 years for any cancer progressions, recurrences and new primaries; and a minimum of 10.3 years for deaths. All treatment and follow-up care received was abstracted from medical records. Data on physical activity including type (occupational, household, recreational) and dose (frequency, intensity and duration) performed during the entire lifetime until diagnosis were examined in Cox proportional hazards models as well as with cumulative incidence curves. An average of 126 MET-hr/week were reported for total physical activity (of which 13.9, 46.9 and 65.3 MET-hr/week were, respectively, for recreational, occupational and household activity). A decreased risk of breast cancer death and all deaths was observed among women in the highest versus the lowest quartiles of recreational activity (MET-hr/week/year) (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). Both moderate (0.56, 95% CI = 0.38-0.82) and vigorous intensity recreational activity (0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.98) decreased the risk of breast cancer death. Moderate intensity recreational activity decreased the risk of a recurrence, progression or new primary cancer (0.66, 95% CI = 0.48-0.91). No other association with breast cancer survival was observed for other types of physical activity. Prediagnosis recreational activity conferred a benefit for survival after breast cancer. Moderate intensity recreational activity was particularly protective.  MP: Purpose: The Exercise for Health trials were randomised, controlled trials designed to evaluate an 8-month pragmatic exercise intervention, commencing 6 weeks post-surgery for women with newly diagnosed breast cancer residing in urban or rural/regional Australia. For these exploratory analyses, the primary and secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. Methods: Consenting urban- (n = 194) and rural/regional-residing women (n = 143) were randomised to exercise (intervention delivered face-to-face or by telephone) or usual care. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for survival outcomes (exercise group, n = 207, 65% urban women; usual care group, n = 130, 46% urban women). Results: After a median follow-up of 8.3 years, there were 11 (5.3%) deaths in the exercise group compared with 15 (11.5%) deaths in the usual care group (OS HR for the exercise group: 0.45, 95% CI 0.20–0.96; p = 0.04). DFS events for the exercise versus usual care group were 25 (12.1%) and 23 (17.7%), respectively (HR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.38–1.17; p = 0.16). HRs for OS favoured exercise irrespective of age, body mass index, stage of disease, intervention compliance, and physical activity levels at 12 months post-diagnosis, although were stronger (p < 0.05) for younger women, women with stage II + disease, women with 1 + comorbidity at time of diagnosis, higher intervention compliance and for those who met national physical activity guidelines at 12 months post-diagnosis. Conclusion: An exercise intervention delivered during and beyond treatment for breast cancer, and that was designed to cater for all women irrespective of place of residence and access to health services, has clear potential to benefit survival. Trial numbers: ACT RN: 012606000233527; ACT RN: 12609000809235.  MP: Context: Physical activity has been shown to decrease the incidence of breast cancer, but the effect on recurrence or survival after a breast cancer diagnosis is not known. Objective: To determine whether physical activity among women with breast cancer decreases their risk of death from breast cancer compared with more sedentary women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective observational study based on responses from 2987 female registered nurses in the Nurses' Health Study who were diagnosed with stage I, II, or III breast cancer between 1984 and 1998 and who were followed up until death or June 2002, whichever came first. Main Outcome Measure: Breast cancer mortality risk according to physical activity category (<;3, 3-8.9, 9-14.9, 15-23.9, or ≥24 metabolic equivalent task [MET] hours per week). Results: Compared with women who engaged in less than 3 MET-hours per week of physical activity, the adjusted relative risk (RR) of death from breast cancer was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.60-1.06) for 3 to 8.9 MET-hours per week; 0.50 (95% CI, 0.31-0.82) for 9 to 14.9 MET-hours per week; 0.56 (95% CI, 0.38-0.84) for 15 to 23.9 MET-hours per week; and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40-0.89) for 24 or more MET-hours per week (P for trend = .004). Three MET-hours is equivalent to walking at average pace of 2 to 2.9 mph for 1 hour. The benefit of physical activity was particularly apparent among women with hormone-responsive tumors. The RR of breast cancer death for women with hormone-responsive tumors who engaged in 9 or more MET-hours per week of activity compared with women with hormone-responsive tumors who engaged in less than 9 MET-hours per week was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34-0.74). Compared with women who engaged in less than 3 MET-hours per week of activity, the absolute unadjusted mortality risk reduction was 6% at 10 years for women who engaged in 9 or more MET-hours per week. Conclusions: Physical activity after a breast cancer diagnosis may reduce the risk of death from this disease. The greatest benefit occurred in women who performed the equivalent of walking 3 to 5 hours per week at an average pace, with little evidence of a correlation between increased benefit and greater energy expenditure. Women with breast cancer who follow US physical activity recommendations may improve their survival.  MP: To investigate whether the impact of postdiagnosis exercise on breast cancer outcomes in women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer differs on the basis of tumor clinicopathologic and molecular features. Using a prospective design, 6,211 patients with early-stage breast cancer from two large population-based cohort studies were studied. Age-adjusted and multivariable Cox regression models were performed to determine the relationship between exercise exposure (total MET-hours/week) and recurrence and breast cancer-related death for: (i) all patients (""unselected"" cohort), and on the basis of (ii) classic clinicopathologic features, (iii) clinical subtypes, (iv) PAM50-based molecular intrinsic subtypes, and (v) individual PAM50 target genes. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years, in the unselected cohort (n = 6,211) increasing exercise exposure was not associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrence (adjusted Ptrend = 0.60) or breast cancer-related death (adjusted Ptrend = 0.39). On the basis of clinicopathologic features, an exercise-associated reduction in breast cancer-related death was apparent for tumors <2 cm [HR, 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-0.72], well/moderately differentiated tumors (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.91), and ER-positive tumors (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97). Stratification by clinical subtype indicated that the ER+/PR+/HER2-/low-grade clinical subtype was preferentially responsive to exercise (recurrence: adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.88; breast cancer-related death: adjusted HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86). The impact of exercise on cancer outcomes appears to differ as a function of pathologic and molecular features in early-stage breast cancer.  MP: Background: Physical activity (PA) before and after breast cancer diagnosis has been reported to be associated with lower mortality. However, whether changes in the activity after diagnosis impact prognosis is unclear and has not received much attention. This study aimed to examine pre- to postdiagnosis leisure-time PA and breast cancer prognosis. Methods: We used data from the MARIE study, a prospective population-based patient cohort study of 3813 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, aged 50-74 at diagnosis, recruited from 2002 to 2005, re-interviewed in 2009, and followed up until June 2015. Prediagnosis PA was assessed at recruitment; postdiagnosis PA was assessed at re-interview in 2009. To examine pre- to postdiagnosis change in PA, women were categorized by pre- and postdiagnosis PA using a cut-off of 7.5 MET-h/week for meeting PA recommendations and combined into four groups: insufficiently active, increasingly active, decreasingly active, and sufficiently active. Cox regression models with delayed entry were used to assess associations between pre- to postdiagnosis patterns of PA and overall mortality (OM), breast cancer mortality (BCM), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additional analyses of pre- and postdiagnosis PA (no activity (reference), low activity, sufficient activity) with cancer outcomes, such as using a time-dependent model, were performed. In total, 2042 patients were included in the analyses. Results: There were 206 deaths (114 from breast cancer) after a median follow-up time of 6.0 years after the 2009 interview. Compared to insufficiently active women, increasingly active women were at lower risk of OM, BCM, and RFS (HR (95%CI) of 0.50 (0.31-0.82), 0.54 (0.30-1.00), 0.58 (0.40-0.84), respectively). In sufficiently active women, associations for OM (0.75 (0.48-1.15)), BCM (0.61 (0.33-1.13)), and RFS 0.80 (0.57-1.14)) were similar to increasingly active women but attenuated, and decreasingly active women were not at lower risk for OM (0.91 (0.61-1.36)), BCM (0.80 (0.45-1.42)), and RFS (1.04 (0.76-1.43)). In time-dependent analyses, sufficient activity vs. no activity was associated with better OM (0.73 (0.57-0.93)), BCM (0.64 (0.46-0.89)), and RFS (0.82 (0.68-0.99)). Low activity was not significantly associated with prognosis. Conclusion: Our data support benefits for breast cancer prognosis in being physically active pre- and postdiagnosis particularly for women who were insufficiently active prediagnosis.  MP: Lifestyle factors have been well studied in relation to breast cancer prognosis overall; however, associations of lifestyle and late outcomes (>5 years after diagnosis) have been much less studied, and no studies have focused on estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer survivors, who may have high risk of late recurrence and mortality. We utilized a large prospective pooling study to evaluate the associations of lifestyle factors with late recurrence and all-cause mortality among 6,295 5-year ER+ Stage I-III breast cancer survivors. Pooled and harmonized data were available on clinical factors and lifestyle factors (pre- to post-diagnosis weight change, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), recreational physical activity, alcohol intake and smoking history), measured on average 2.1 years after diagnosis. Updated information for weight only was available. Study heterogeneity was evaluated by the Q-statistic. Multivariable Cox regression models were stratified by study. Adjusting for clinical factors and potential confounders, ≥10% weight gain and obesity (BMI, 30-34.99 and ≥35) were associated with increased risk of late recurrence (hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals): 1.24 (1.00-1.53), 1.40 (1.05-1.86) and 1.41 (1.02-1.93), respectively). Daily alcohol intake was associated with late recurrence, 1.28 (1.01-1.62). Physical activity was inversely associated with late all-cause mortality (0.81 (0.71-0.93) and 0.71 (0.61-0.82) for 4.9 to <17.4 and ≥17.4 metabolic equivalent-hr/week). A U-shaped association was observed for late all-cause mortality and BMI using updated weight (1.42 (1.15-1.74) and 1.40 (1.09-1.81), <21.5 and ≥35, respectively). Smoking was associated with increased risk of late outcomes. In this large prospective pooling project, modifiable lifestyle factors were associated with late outcomes among long-term ER+ breast cancer survivors.  MP: Evidence is emerging that physical activity (PA) may improve overall survival after breast cancer diagnosis. However, the effect of PA on breast cancer recurrence and on cause-specific mortality is less investigated. We assessed the association of pre-diagnosis PA with recurrence, overall and cause-specific survival in a prospective cohort study in Germany including 3,393 non-metastatic breast cancer patients aged 50-74 years. Cox proportional hazards models were calculated adjusted for relevant prognostic factors. During a median follow-up of 5.6 years, 367 patients deceased. Overall mortality was significantly inversely associated with pre-diagnosis recreational PA. However, this effect was mainly attributed to deaths due to causes other than breast cancer. Multiple fractional polynomial analyses yielded a nonlinear association with markedly increased non-breast cancer mortality for women who did not engage in any sports or cycling in the years before the breast cancer diagnosis with a hazard ratio (HR, none vs. any) of 1.71, 95% confidence interval (1.16, 2.52). There were no further risk reductions with increasing activity levels. The association with breast cancer-specific mortality showed a similar dose-response but was far less pronounced with HR (none vs. any) = 1.22 (0.91, 1.64). In contrast, regarding cancer recurrence the dose-response was linear. However, this association was restricted to estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative (ER-/PR-) cases (pinteraction = 0.033) with HR (highest vs. no recreational PA) = 0.53 (0.24, 1.16), ptrend = 0.0045. Thus, breast cancer patients with a physically inactive lifestyle pre-diagnosis may decease prematurely irrespective of their cancer prognosis. Higher levels of exercise may reduce the risk of recurrence of ER-/PR- breast tumors. What's new? Whether pre-diagnosis physical activity impacts risk of recurrence and mortality from breast cancer has remained unclear, though such associations could have implications for the interpretation of patient outcome. Here, analysis of data on 3,393 nonmetastatic breast cancer patients reveals an inverse association between pre-diagnosis physical activity and overall mortality, but primarily for instances of death apparently unrelated to breast cancer, such as non-breast neoplasms and circulatory events. Higher levels of exercise were linked to a reduced risk of disease recurrence among patients with ER-/PR- breast tumors."
"The objective of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of Salmonella in multiple food commodities in the People's Republic of China by performing a meta-analysis. Accordingly, we screened studies that examined the prevalence of Salmonella in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Methodological quality assessment and heterogeneity analyses were performed for included studies. The prevalence rate with the 95% confidence interval (CI) was selected as the effect size. Subgroup analyses for each food type were conducted and then stratified by regions, food chain processing points, and seasons. In total, 49 studies were included in the meta-analysis, among them, 8 (16.3%) studies were deemed “high risk,” 13 (26.5%) studies were “unclear risk,” and 28 (57.2%) studies were “low risk.” The overall prevalence rate of Salmonella was 20.0% (95% CI: 15.9 to 24.4). The prevalence rate of Salmonella in raw meat products was 23.6% (95% CI: 19.8 to 27.6), which was higher than that in aquatic products, 13.7% (95% CI: 3.1 to 29.9), milk products, 0.9% (95% CI: 0.0 to 3.9), frozen convenience foods, 6.5% (95% CI: 4.4 to 8.9), ready-to-eat foods, 2.0% (95% CI: 1.1 to 3.2), vegetables and fruits, 0.9% (95% CI: 0.0 to 5.2), and shell eggs, 4.2% (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.7). Subgroup analyses revealed that prevalence rates of Salmonella in raw meat products from abattoirs, 26.3% (95% CI: 17.4 to 36.3) and retail stores, 30.0% (95% CI: 24.6 to 35.8) were higher than those determined from farms, 10.2% (95% CI: 7.0 to 13.9); P < 0.05); however, no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of Salmonella stratified by different geographical regions or seasons (P > 0.05). On the basis of these findings, high levels of Salmonella contamination could be detected in raw meat products in China, and the prevalence rate of Salmonella in raw meat products from abattoirs and retail stores was high.","MP: The prevalence of Salmonella from chicken and pig slaughterhouses in Henan, China and antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates to antibiotics was determined. From 283 chicken samples and 240 pig samples collected, 128 and 70 Salmonella isolates were recovered with an isolation rate of 45.2 and 29.2% respectively. The predominant serovars in chicken samples were S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Hadar and S. enterica serovar Indiana, while those in pig samples were S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Derby and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was 8.6 and 10.0% for isolates from chickens and pigs respectively, whereas resistance to cefotaxime was 5.5 and 8.6%, respectively. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial agent) was markedly higher in pig isolates (57.1%) than in chicken isolates (39.8%). Of particular concern was the detection of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates, which pose risk to public health. All 16 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates detected were resistant to ciprofloxacin, among which 11 were co-resistant to cefotaxime. The S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates accumulated point mutations in quinolone resistance determination regions of gyrA (S83F/D87G or S83F/D87N) and parC (T57S/S80R). Two plasmid mediated quinolone resistant determinants were found with aac (6')-Ib-cr and oqxAB in 16 and 12 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates respectively. Cefotaxime-resistance of S. enterica serovar Indiana was associated with the acquisition of a blaCTX-M-65 gene. The potential risk of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana infection is a significant concern due to limited alternative treatment options. Reduction of Salmonella in chicken and pig slaughterhouses, in particular, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana will be an important measure to reduce the public health burden of Salmonella infections.  MP: An epidemiological investigation of Salmonella spp. in pig and pork samples from one slaughterhouse and its downstream retail markets in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, was conducted from October 2013 to March 2014. A total of 71.8% (155/216) and 70.9% (78/110), respectively, of the slaughterhouse and retail market samples were recovered positive for Salmonella. All Salmonella isolates were characterized using serotyping, antimicrobial resistance detection, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Seven serotypes were shared by isolates from the two sources, with the most common serotypes being Salmonella Derby, Typhimurium, and Uganda. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing revealed that the highest antimicrobial resistance rate was against tetracycline (49.7% and 37.2% in isolates from the slaughterhouse and retail market, respectively) with many multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates in both sources. MLST analysis showed that eight sequence type (ST) patterns were shared, and ST40 occupied an absolute superiority among isolates from both sources. PFGE permitted the resolution of XbaI macrorestriction fragments of the selected 31 Salmonella Derby and 19 Salmonella Typhimurium into 30 and 10 distinct pulsotypes, displaying the high similarity between the isolates from the two sources. Our findings indicated that Salmonella isolates from a slaughterhouse and its downstream retail markets were phenotypically and genetically homologous. Additionally, Salmonella may propagate along the slaughter line and pork production chain from the slaughterhouse to retail markets.  MP: This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Chinese food products. The prevalence of these pathogens was 3.46%, 5.79%, 7%, 0.24%, and 0%, respectively. Raw meats were mainly contaminated with Salmonella (39/365, 10.7%), L. monocytogenes (26/365, 7.1%), and S. aureus (40/365, 11%), while cooked food products were mainly contaminated with L. monocytogenes (45/384, 11.7%) followed by S. aureus (12/384, 3.1%), and raw milk was mainly contaminated with S. aureus (34/209, 16.3%) and Salmonella (4/209, 1.9%). Antimicrobial resistance was evaluated in Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus. Antimicrobial resistance for L. monocytogenes was most frequently observed for cefotaxime (51/72, 70.8%) followed by furazolidone (40/72, 55.6%). Multiple resistance (resistance to ≥2 antibiotics) was observed for 63.9% (46/72) of L. monocytogenes isolates. Resistance of Salmonella was most frequently observed to amoxicillin (11.6%), ticarcilline (11.6%), cephalothin (11.6%), and cefuroxime (11.6%). Multiple resistance was observed for 16.3% (7/43) of the Salmonella isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to penicillin (93.1%) followed by tetracycline and oxacillin COAG (49.4% and 37.9%, respectively). About 79% (69/87) of S. aureus isolated demonstrated multiple resistance. The data showed that raw meat, cooked food products, and raw milk were most commonly contaminated with foodborne pathogens and many pathogens were resistant to different antibiotics. The study provided useful information for assessment of the possible risk posed to Chinese consumers, which has significant public health impact in China.  MP: The aim of this study was to determinate the prevalence of Salmonella in retail foods and its resistance to quinolones in retail foods in Lanzhou, People's Republic of China. In this work, 2,182 food samples, collected from March 2015 to December 2018, were analyzed to detect Salmonella and then analyzed for serotype distribution, quinolone resistance, and quinolone-resistant gene detection. The findings demonstrate that the overall prevalence of Salmonella in these food categories was low. A total of 41 (1.9%) of 2,182 food samples were found to be positive for Salmonella. Ten distinct serovars were identified, and Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Anatum, and Salmonella Enteritidis were the most prevalent serovars. According to the broth microdilution test, the resistance percentages were 90.2% to nalidixic acid, 39.0% to enrofloxacin, 41.5% to ciprofloxacin, 29.3% to ofloxacin, and 26.8% to levofloxacin. Among the quinolone-resistant isolates, 12 strains had a single mutation in gyrA at codon 83 (Ser→Phe) or codon 87 (Asp→Asn or Asp→Gly). Five isolates had one parC mutation (Ser80→Arg) and one or two gyrA hot spot mutations. qnr genes were found in seven isolates (five qnrB and two qnrD), and the aac(6′)-Ib gene in seven isolates. Two isolates carry both qnrB and aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes. Based on these results, a low prevalence of Salmonella contamination in retail foods was found, but it might play a potential risk factor in the spread of quinolone-resistant Salmonella strains in the Lanzhou region.  MP: Background: Salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens, causing outbreaks of human salmonellosis worldwide. Owing to large scales of consumption markets, pork and poultry that contaminated by Salmonella could pose a tremendous threat to public health. The aim of this study was to investigate the contamination of Salmonella from chicken, pork and the environment in slaughtering and retail processes in Chongqing, China. Results: A total of 115 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 1112 samples collected from pork, chicken and the environment. Compared with the isolation rate of samples from chicken (9.50%) and the environment (6.23%), samples from pork had a significant higher isolation rate (44.00%). The isolation rates in slaughterhouses (10.76%) and in supermarkets (10.07%) showed no statistical difference. Thirty different serotypes were identified among all the isolates. S. Derby (n = 26), S. London (n = 16) and S. Rissen (n = 12) were the dominant serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 73.04% isolates were resistant to tetracycline, followed by 66.96% to ampicillin and 59.13% to doxycycline. More than half (50.43%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), and most of the MDR isolates were from supermarkets. Multilocus sequence typing results showed 24 out of 115 isolates were ST40, which was the most prevalent. Furthermore, isolates from supermarkets had 20 different sequence types while isolates from slaughterhouses only had 8 different sequence types. Conclusion: Our study highlighted that Salmonella was more frequently isolated in pork production chain than that in chicken. Compared with isolates from slaughterhouses, isolates from supermarkets had more MDR profiles and represented a wider range of serotypes and sequence types, indicating that the retail process had more diverse sources of Salmonella contamination than that of slaughtering process.  MP: Salmonella is an important cause of foodborne diseases. This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution, antimicrobial resistance, virulence genes, and genetic diversity of Salmonella isolates recovered from fresh duck meat obtained from retail markets in Southern China. In total, 365 samples of fresh duck meat were collected from retail markets in six different cities of Guangdong Province between May 2017 and April 2019. High levels of Salmonella contamination were detected in duck meat (151/365, 41.4%). Twenty-six different Salmonella serotypes were identified: S. Corvallis (n = 25, 16.6%), S. Kentucky (n = 22, 14.6%) and S. Agona (n = 20, 13.3%) were the most prevalent serotypes. All isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 133 (88.1%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). Most (86.1%) Salmonella isolates carried seven classes of virulence-associated genes. This study showed the diversity of Salmonella serotypes and genotypes and the high prevalence of MDR isolates carrying multiple virulence-associated genes among isolates from duck meat obtained from retail markets in Southern China. Isolates from different districts had similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns indicating that circulating foodborne Salmonella constitutes a potential public health issue across different districts.  MP: This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates. High levels of Salmonella contamination were detected in pork (67.0%), duck (50.5%) and chicken (46.2%). Thirty different serotypes were identified among 500 detected Salmonella isolates, as well as significant differences in serotypes between different retail meat samples. Notably, 405 (80.1%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). Meanwhile, we also found that 74 (14.8%) Salmonella isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the major mechanisms underlying this resistance were investigated. The commonest mutations in gyrA S83F (40.5%) and D87N (35.1%), and in parC was T57S (71.6%) and S80I (35.1%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the S. Kentucky isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin mostly belonged to ST198 (21/23, 91.3%) and PFGE revealed the presence of various genotypes. This study identified a diversity of Salmonella serotypes and a high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, which indicates that foodborne Salmonella potentially constitutes a potential food safety risk.   MP: The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence and fluoroquinolone resistant Salmonella isolated from an integrated broiler chicken supply chain and their molecular characterization. In total, 73 Salmonella isolates were recovered from a broiler chicken supply chain in Shanghai. Salmonella isolates were tested for susceptibility to 11 antimicrobial agents using the broth dilution method and were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Then, the Salmonella isolates were examined for mutations in quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE, and were screened for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. Lastly, we sequenced the plasmids carrying qnrS1 in six Salmonella isolates from three sources (two isolated per source). Among 73 Salmonella isolates, 45 isolates were identified as S. Indiana, 24 were S. Schwarzengrund, 2 were S. Enteritidis, and 2 were S. Stanleyville. In addition, high rates of resistance were detected for nalidixic acid (41.1%) and ciprofloxacin (37.0%), while resistance to other test agents was diverse (2.0–100%). S. Indiana and S. Schwarzengrund isolates from different sources exhibited the same PFGE pattern, suggesting that the Salmonella isolates possessed high potential to spread along the broiler chicken supply chain. gyrA and parC exhibited frequent missense mutations. Moreover, qnrS1 was the most prevalent PMQR gene in the 73 Salmonella isolates, and it was found about a new hybrid plasmid. This study concludes a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistant Salmonella in chicken supply chain, threatening the treatment of Salmonella foodborne diseases. In particular, the emergence of a new hybrid plasmid carrying qnrS1 indicates that the recombination of plasmid carrying resistance gene might be a potential risk factor for the prevention and control strategies of drug resistance.  MP: The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, distribution, and diversity of three foodborne bacteria in kiwifruit orchards and processing plants. Fourteen kiwifruit orchards and two processing plants in Shaanxi province were visited for sampling in 2012. Fruit samples and environmental samples in orchards and plants were taken for isolation of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella. All isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and detection of virulence genes. Selected isolates were further examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. In total, 160 E. coli isolates and 14 S. aureus isolates were recovered from 407 samples from orchards and plants, while no Salmonella was recovered. E. coli isolates displayed resistance most frequently to streptomycin (65.6%), and S. aureus isolates displayed resistance most frequently to erythromycin (21.4%). Three E. coli isolates (1.9%) were positive for stx2 and two S. aureus isolates (14.3%) were positive for both seb and seh. Seventy-seven E. coli isolates and 14 S. aureus isolates were analyzed by PFGE. PFGE results showed that both E. coli and S. aureus isolates were diverse, and blades for slicing during the processing could be an important contamination source. This study could provide useful information for kiwifruit growers and industry to establish proper management practices that help minimize the chance of microbial contamination from farm to table.  MP: In this study, a total of 323 Salmonella enterica strains were isolated from 3,566 rectal swab samples of 51 poultry farms in seven regions of 12 provinces of China between 2006 and 2012. The prevalences of Salmonella sp. carriage were 12.4% in geese (66 positive/ 533 samples), 10.4% in turkeys (32/309), 9.8% in chickens (167/1,706), 6.8% in ducks (41/601), and 4.1% in pigeons (17/417), respectively. These isolates belonged to 20 serovars, in which the most frequent serovars were S. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Pullorum (herein, S. Pullorum) (55 isolates, 17.0%), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (50 isolates, 15.5%), and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (39 isolates, 12.1%). Overall, S. Typhimurium was the most commonly detected serovar; among the individual species, S. Pullorum was most commonly isolated from chickens, S. Enteritidis was most common in ducks, S. Typhimurium was most common in geese and pigeons, and S. enterica serovar Saintpaul was most common in turkeys. PCR determination of 20 fimbrial genes demonstrated the presence of bcfD, csgA, fimA, stdB, and sthE genes and the absence of staA and stgA genes in these isolates, and other loci were variably distributed, with frequency values ranging from 11.8 to 99.1%. These 323 Salmonella isolates were subdivided into 41 different fimbrial genotypes, and of these isolate, 285 strains (88.2%) had 12 to 14 fimbrial genes. Our findings indicated that the Salmonella isolates from different poultry species were phenotypically and genetically diverse and that some fimbrial genes are more frequently associated with serovars or serogroups.  MP: Salmonella has been known as the most important foodborne pathogen, which can infect humans via consuming contaminated food. Chicken meat has been known as an important vehicle to transmit Salmonella by the food supply chain. This study determined the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and genetic characteristics of Salmonella at different chicken slaughtering stages in East China. In total, 114 out of 200 (57%) samples were Salmonella positive, while Salmonella contamination was gradually increasing from the scalding and unhairing stage (17.5%) to the subdividing stage (70%) throughout the slaughtering. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was then performed to analyze the serotype, antimicrobial resistance gene profiles, and genetic relationship of all Salmonella isolates. The most common serotypes were S. Kentucky (51/114, 44.7%) and S. Enteritidis (37/114, 32.5%), which were distributed throughout the four slaughtering stages, and were also identified in the corresponding environments. The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that seven sequence types (STs) were occupied by six different serotypes, respectively. Only S. Kentucky had two STs, ST314 was the predominant ST shared by 50 isolates, while the ST198 has 1 isolate. The antimicrobial resistance gene analysis demonstrated that most of the strains belonging to S. Kentucky (39/51, 76.5%) and S. Indiana (15, 100%) contained over five groups of antimicrobial resistance genes. Based on the core genome analysis, 50 S. Kentucky isolates were genetically identical, indicating that one S. Kentucky strain with the same genetic background was prevalent in the chicken slaughtering line. Although 37 S. Enteritidis isolates only had three different antimicrobial resistance gene profiles, the core genome sequence analysis subtyped these S. Enteritidis isolates into five different clusters, which revealed the diverse genetic background of S. Enteritidis in the slaughterhouse. The antimicrobial resistance phenotypes were consistent with the presence of the corresponding resistance genes of S. Kentucky and S. Enteritidis, including tetA, floR, blaTEM-1B, strA/B, sul1/sul2, and gyrA (D87Y). Our study observed a high prevalence of Salmonella in the chicken slaughter line and identified the slaughtering environment as a main source of causing Salmonella cross-contamination during chicken slaughtering. Further studies will be needed to limit the transmission of Salmonella in the slaughterhouse.  MP: With the increase in commercial pig farming, there is a simultaneous increase in the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis as well as therapeutics in China. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence and resistance diversity of salmonellae isolated from feces of asymptomatic, live and slaughtered pigs. We analyzed 1,732 pig fecal samples collected over 8 months, at Henan province of China. The salmonellae were isolated and identified by PCR. They were serotyped using commercial antisera and assayed for the MIC of 16 antibiotics by broth microdilution method. The average prevalence of Salmonella was 19.4% (95% CI: 17.6-21.4). Large farms (herd size ≥1,000) were found to have a higher prevalence as compared to the small- and medium-scale farms (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of salmonellae in samples collected from the farms [11.77% (95% CI: 10.1-13.6)] and from the slaughterhouse [45.23% (95% CI: 40.3-50.30)] was statistically different (p < 0.0001). Uncommon serovars of Salmonella such as Agama and common serovars such as Derby and Typhimurium were isolated. High resistance (>80%) was recorded toward ciprofloxacin (100%), tetracycline (99.4%), doxycycline (97%), sulfamethoxazole (85.8%), ampicillin (81.6%), and amoxicillin (80.4%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) to four, five, and seven classes of antibiotics was recorded to be approximately 25% in the most prevalent serovar like Derby. We conclude that the presence of alarmingly high resistance, toward the critical antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams, in large swine farms in China, should draw public attention. These results highlight the need for continued antibiotic stewardship programs for judicious use of critical antibiotics in animal health as well as for producing safe pork.  MP: This study was designed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella in three Chinese pig abattoirs (A, B, and C) in Wuhan city in 2016. Four types of pig samples were collected and cultured for Salmonella. Salmonella was detected from 329 samples among the 1440 tested (22.9%). There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence between the first visit and the second visit and among the three abattoirs. Rectal swabs (RS) exhibited a significantly higher prevalence than carcass swabs and pork. A total of 177 isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Among 17 sequence types (STs) and 13 serotypes detected, ST40, ST469, and ST34, corresponding to serovars Derby, Rissen, and Typhimurium, respectively, were predominant. The isolates from different abattoirs exhibited diverse ST distribution. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the microdilution broth method. Resistance to at least one of the antimicrobials was observed for 96.6% of the strains (171/177), and multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates accounted for 75.7% of the strains (134/177). The highest resistance proportion was for tetracycline (92.7%), and the lowest was for cefotaxime (14.1%). The isolates from abattoir A exhibited a significantly lower MDR proportion than those from other abattoirs (p < 0.05). The isolates recovered from RS and pork samples exhibited significantly higher MDR proportions than those recovered from carcass swab samples. Notably, among three predominant STs of isolates, the ST34 isolates showed the highest MDR proportion. In view of the high Salmonella prevalence and antimicrobial resistance, great attention must be paid to the monitoring and controlling of Salmonella in a full pork production chain.  MP: Salmonella is an important food-borne pathogen associated with public health and high economic losses. To investigate the prevalence and the characteristics of Salmonella in a pig slaughterhouse in Yangzhou, a total of 80 Salmonella isolates were isolated from 459 (17.43%) samples in 2016–2017. S. Derby (35/80, 43.75%) was the most prevalent, followed by S. Rissen (16/80, 20.00%) and S. Newlands (11/80, 13.75%). The highest rates of susceptibility were observed to cefoxitin (80/80, 100.0%) and amikacin (80/80, 100.0%), followed by aztreonam (79/80, 98.75%) and nitrofurantoin (79/80, 98.75%). The highest resistance rate was detected for tetracycline (65/80, 81.25%), followed by ampicillin (60/80, 75.00%), bactrim (55/80, 68.75%), and sulfisoxazole (54/80, 67.50%). Overall, 91.25% (73/80) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, while 71.25% (57/80) of the isolate strains were multidrug resistant in the antimicrobial susceptibility tested. In addition, 86.36% (19/22) of the 22 antimicrobial resistance genes in the isolates were identified. Our data indicated that the resistance to certain antimicrobials was significantly associated, in part, with antimicrobial resistance genes. Furthermore, 81.25% (65/80) isolates harbored the virulence gene of mogA, of which 2 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates carried the mogA, spvB and spvC virulence genes at the same time. The results showed that swine products in the slaughterhouse were contaminated with multidrug resistant Salmonella commonly, especially some isolates carry the spv virulence genes. The virulence genes might facilitate the dissemination of the resistance genes to consumers along the production chain, suggesting the importance of controlling Salmonella during slaughter for public health.  MP: This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of Salmonella isolated from different parts of the food production chain, and to characterize these isolates. A total of 165 Salmonella enterica isolates were identified from 1382 samples taken from conventional farms, abattoirs and retail markets from 2010 to 2011 in Sichuan, China. The Salmonella isolates were assayed for serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, prevalence of class 1 integrons and β-lactamase genes, and subtyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among these isolates, S. enterica serotypes Derby (76 isolates, 46%) and Typhimurium (16 isolates, 10%) were the most prevalent, and high antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for tetracycline (77%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (43%), nalidixic acid (41%) and spectinomycin (41%). Class 1 integrons were detected in 21% of these isolates, and contained gene cassettes dfrA12–aadA2, dfrA1–aadA1, dfrA1, blaPSE-1 and dfrA1/aadA2. blaOXA-1 was the most commonly identified β-lactamase gene (n = 14), followed by blaTEM-1 (n = 6), blaPSE-1 (n = 4) and blaCMY-2 (n = 1). A S. enterica serotype Indiana isolate derived from chicken from a market was positive for both blaOXA-1 and blaCMY-2, and resistant to nine tested antibiotics. The PFGE patterns were diverse. Our findings indicated that most isolates from different sampling sites were phenotypically and genetically diverse, and Salmonella was widespread and may transmit along the food production chain from farm to market. Isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, which are used to fight foodborne Salmonella, pose a serious threat to public health.  MP: The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella isolated from meat samples of commercial broilers (CB) and spent hens (SH). Between March and June 2016, 200 retail raw chicken carcasses (100 from CB and 100 from SH) were obtained from local supermarkets in Tai'an city of China, and Salmonella isolates were then analyzed for antibiotic resistance, serotype, β-lactamase genes, and the presence of class 1 integron. Forty Salmonella strains were obtained in this study (CB: 21/100, 21%; SH: 19/100, 19%). Three serotypes were identified in 40 Salmonella, and S. Enteritidis (CB: 15/21, 71.4%; SH: 10/19, 52.6%) was the dominant serotype, followed by S. Typhimurium (CB: 4/21, 19%; SH: 6/19, 31.6%) and S. Derby (CB: 2/21, 9.5%; SH: 3/19, 15.8%). Among 21 Salmonella isolated from CB, high antibiotic resistance rates were found for ampicillin (20/21, 95.2%), nalidixic acid (18/21, 85.7%), cefotaxime (17/21, 81%), and tetracycline (13/21, 61.9%); class 1 integron was observed in seven isolates (7/21, 33.3%), and gene cassettes included an empty integron (0.15 kb, n = 1), aadA2 (1.2 kb, n = 3), drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1), and drfA17-aadA5 (1.7 kb, n = 2); blaTEM-1 was the dominant β-lactamase gene (21/21, 100%), followed by blaCTX-M-55 (7/21, 33.3%). Among 19 Salmonella isolated from SH, high antibiotic resistance rates were found for nalidixic acid (19/19, 100%), tetracycline (19/19, 100%), ampicillin (18/19, 94.7%), and ciprofloxacin (13/19, 68.4%); class 1 integron was observed in two isolates (2/19, 10.5%), and gene cassettes included drfA17-aadA5 (1.7 kb, n = 1) and drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1); blaTEM-1 was the dominant β-lactamase gene (19/19, 100%), followed by blaCTX-M-55 (2/19, 10.5%) and blaCMY-2 (1/19, 5.3%). Collectively, antibiotic-resistant Salmonella can be widely detected in retail raw chicken carcasses of CB and SH, and therefore can pose a serious risk to public health.   MP: Poultry products such as eggs provide essential nutrients to the human body and thus play vital roles in the human food network. Salmonella is one of the most notorious foodborne pathogens and has been found to be prevalent in eggs. To better understand the characteristics of Salmonella in eggs, we investigated the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in 814 fresh eggs collected from poultry farms and retail marketplaces in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China. The serotype, genotype, and antibiotic susceptibilities of 61 Salmonella isolates recovered from the eggs were analyzed. The average detection rate of Salmonella-positive eggs was 5.6%, with 6.6% of the eggs collected from poultry farms and 5.1% from marketplaces. Thirteen serotypes were identified from the 61 isolates, among which Salmonella Typhimurium (24.5%) and Salmonella Indiana (22.9%) were the most prevalent serotypes. Other dominant serotypes included Salmonella Thompson (13.1%) and Salmonella Enteritidis (11.4%), with the remaining nine serotypes detected at low rates (1.6–4.9%). All the Salmonella isolates tested were resistant to sulfisoxazole (100.0%). The majority (77.1%) of the isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin, while nearly two-thirds (63.9–68.9%) were resistant to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, kanamycin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol. The rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin was 40.1%; the resistance rates to streptomycin, ceftiofur, and ceftriaxone ranged from 21.3 to 26.2%; and those to gentamicin, amikacin, and cefoxitin were relatively low (3.3–16.4%). Forty-nine (80.3%) Salmonella isolates exhibited resistance to multiple antibiotics, 20 (32.8%) of which were resistant to at least 10 antibiotics. Subtyping by pulse-field gel electrophoresis revealed a close genetic relatedness of Salmonella isolates from poultry farms, in striking contrast to the high diversity of the isolates obtained from marketplaces. Isolates of the same serotype always shared identical genotype and antibiotic resistance profiles, even the ones that were recovered from eggs sampled at different locations and times. These findings indicate that diverse Salmonella spp. with high rates of multidrug resistance are prevalent in fresh eggs in the study area. More attention should be paid to egg production, transportation, and storage to prevent foodborne outbreaks caused by Salmonella.  MP"
"Introduction The association between folic acid (FA) and erectile dysfunction (ED) was contradictory in the published original articles, and no meta-analysis was conducted to pool these data.  Aim To verify the role of FA in the pathology of ED and explore the treatment efficacy of FA for ED patients.  Methods An extensive search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to obtain all relevant studies published up to October 31, 2020. Studies comparing the serum FA level between ED patients and healthy controls, or comparing the score of the IIEF-5, or IIEF before and after folic acid therapy alone or combination in ED patient were eligible for our meta-analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scales (NOS) was used to qualify included studies.  Main Outcome Measures The standardized mean differences (SMD) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to pool our data.  Results Nine studies were eligible for our meta-analysis to verify the association between FA and ED, and to explore the treatment efficacy of FA for ED patients. The pooled SMD of the FA level difference between ED patients and healthy subjects was -0.94 (95% CI: -1.59, -0.30, P = .004). Moreover, the level of folic acid in healthy subjects, Mild ED patients, Moderate ED patients and Severe ED patients was 11.847 (95%CI = 9.671, 14.022), 9.496 (95%CI = 8.425, 10.567), 6.597 (95%CI = 5.187, 8.007) and 5.623 (95%CI = 3.535, 7.711) respectively. The SMD of changes in score of IIEF-5 was 1.89 with 95%CI (1.60, 2.17) after FA administration in ED patients. Our analysis also showed that combination therapy of FA plus tadalafil changed the score of IIEF with 0.90 (95%CI = 0.44, 1.36) comparing to combination of placebo plus tadalafil.  Conclusion This novel meta-analysis demonstrated that FA was an independent risk factor for ED and FA supplement may have potentially positive effects in the treatment of ED patients.","MP: A growing body of evidence suggests a role for homocysteine (Hcys) and folate (FA) in erectile function (EF): Hcys appears to impair EF affecting endothelium via several mechanism whereas the role of FA remains to be elucidated, besides decreasing Hcys. To assess correlation between erectile dysfunction (ED) and serum levels of FA, Hcys, and B12, we enrolled 31 patients affected by ED (Group A; age 52.83 ± 11.89 years) and 31 healthy adults (Group B; age 49.14 ± 13.63 years). Fasting blood samples were taken for each subject. ED was assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). IIEF-5 mean score was significantly lower in Group A than in Group B (10.71 ± 4.24 versus 23.32 ± 1.33, p < .001). Compared to Group B, Group A also showed significantly lower serum FA levels (5.11 ± 1.79 versus 7.9 ± 3.55 ng/ml, p < .001) and significantly higher serum Hcys levels (13.61 ± 3.55 versus 9.17 ± 2.32 µmol/L, p < .001). No significant correlation was observed between Hcys and FA both groups. Our results showed a significant association among ED, FA deficiency and hyperomocisteinemia. Lack of correlation between FA and Hcys suggests that FA deficit may directly impair EF.  MP: Objectives Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects up to 53.4% of men aged 30–80 years. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between homocysteine (HCY), vitamin B12 (B12), folic acid (FA) and ED.  Design Cross-sectional study.  Setting Guangxi, China.  Participants A total of 1381 participants who completed questionnaires were included, between September 2009 and December 2009.  Measures ED was evaluated by the International Index of Erectile Function scores. Also, the values of HCY, B12 and FA were acquired. Then, regression and between-group analyses were performed.  Results No association between FA and ED was found. Significant correlations between HCY and ED were found—the relationships between these two parameters were most notable in men aged over 60 years and in men living alone (bachelors or bachelorhood). B12 levels were higher in men with ED (718.53±234.37 pg/mL vs 688.74±229.68, p=0.015). Using multinomial logistic regression analyses, B12 levels were related to mild ED (multivariate adjusted analysis: OR 1.620, 95% CI 1.141 to 2.300, p=0.007), especially among men aged 40–49 years (OR 2.907, 95% CI 1.402 to 6.026, p=0.004).  Conclusions We report, for the first time, a relationship between B12 levels and ED. We also found specific cohorts of men for whom the relationship between HCY levels and ED is most prominent. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these relationships—these may ultimately result in new therapies for ED.

MP: Purpose The purpose of the study was to compare serum level of folic acid (FA) in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) versus healthy controls and to assess its correlation with other well-known confounders for ED.  Methods Our prospective study compared FA in 60 patients with ED versus 30 healthy controls. Patients were excluded if they had any hormonal disorders, Peyronie’s disease, or decompensated systemic illnesses. ED was evaluated by the validated Arabic version of the abbreviated five-item form of the International Index Of Erectile Function and confirmed by penile duplex. Serum FA level was assayed using ELIZA. Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis, and Chi-square tests and Spearman correlation were used as appropriate and confirmed by logistic regression model.  Results Our study revealed that the median FA of the cases and the controls were 7.1 ng/mL and 13.4 ng/mL, respectively, and this difference was of high statistical significance (p < 0.001). Moreover, our study demonstrated significant relations between serum FA with DM, HTN, smoking, age, and cholesterol (p 0.01, 0.03, 0.014, 0.001, and 0.015, respectively). Our study showed that the best cut-off point of serum FA to detect patients with ED was found to be ≤ 9.42 with sensitivity of 80.00%, specificity of 93.33% and area under curve (AUC) of 91.3%.  Conclusion Serum FA level decreased as the severity of ED increased even after adjustment of age, serum testosterone, DM, HTN, and smoking. FA deficiency might be an independent risk factor of ED.  MP: The purpose of this study was to compare the serum Folic Acid (FA) levels in patients with Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and healthy controls and whether levels vary with its severity. The study was carried out on 77 sexually active individuals, out of which 41 complained of ED and 36 were apparently normal. Patients were excluded if they had any diseases known to cause ED. The severity was further categorised based on IIEF-5 scores. Blood serum levels of testosterone, lipid profile, random blood sugar, liver function test, renal function test and FA levels were obtained in each patient. Independent-samples t test of significance was used when comparing between two means. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) test was used for correlating data. All clinical and biochemical parameters except FA were comparable in both the groups. FA levels were significantly decreased in ED group (5.29 vs. 10.8; p value = .004). Smoking habits were comparable between the groups, and FA levels did not vary among smokers and nonsmokers (p value = .46). Serum FA levels significantly declined with increasing severity of ED (8.28 vs. 5.56 vs. 4.37 vs. 3.5; p value < .001). Thus, decreased FA might possibly be one of the novel risk factors for ED.  MP: We investigated serum folic acid (FA) levels in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) and/or premature ejaculation (PE). Fasting serum samples were obtained from 42 patients with ED, 36 with PE, 25 ED patients with PE, and 30 healthy men; the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was measured during a 4 weeks baseline period. Levels of sex hormones (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone), homocysteine (Hcys), and FA were measured using chemiluminescent immunoassays. The sexual functions of PE patients and normal control men were evaluated using the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (CIPE). The abridged International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaire was used to gauge erectile quality for ED patients and for normal controls. Serum FA concentrations were lower in ED (7.61 ± 3.97 ng ml -1), PE (9.37 ± 3.40 ng ml -1), and ED/PE (8.84 ± 4.28 ng ml -1 ) patients than in healthy men (12.23 ± 5.76 ng ml -1 , P < 0.05). No significant differences in sex hormone levels were found between patients with sexual dysfunction and healthy controls (P > 0.05). There were positive correlations between serum FA concentrations and CIPE scores (r = 0.530, P < 0.01), IIEF-5 scores (r = 0.589, P < 0.01), and IELT (r = 0.445, P < 0.01); negative correlations with Hcys concentrations (r = -0.487, P < 0.01) were found in all participants. These findings showed a strong relationship between serum FA levels and sexual dysfunction, possibly due to an effect of FA on the metabolism of nitric oxide, Hcys, and 5-hydroxytryptamine.   MP: This study measured the serum folic acid (FA) level in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) and evaluated the possible association between the serum FA level and erectile function. The study divided 120 patients with ED into 3 groups of 40 patients each: those with severe, moderate and mild ED. Forty healthy men served as controls. Fasting serum samples were obtained, and the total testosterone, cholesterol and FA levels were measured using chemiluminescent immunoassays. There were no significant differences in the mean age, mean body mass index or mean serum total testosterone and cholesterol levels among the three ED groups and controls (P > 0.05). The mean serum FA concentrations were 7.2 ± 3.7, 7.1 ± 3.2, 10.2 ± 4.6 and 10.7 ± 4.6 ng ml−1 in the severe, moderate and mild ED and control groups respectively. The mean serum FA concentration was significantly higher in the control group than in the severe and moderate ED groups (both P < 0.001), but not the mild ED group (P = 0.95). Considering the significant differences in the serum FA levels between the control and ED groups, serum FA deficiency might reflect the severity of ED.  MP: A growing body of evidence suggests a role for homocysteine (Hcys) and folate (FA) in erectile function (EF): Hcys appears to impair EF affecting endothelium via several mechanism whereas the role of FA remains to be elucidated, besides decreasing Hcys. To assess correlation between erectile dysfunction (ED) and serum levels of FA, Hcys, and B12, we enrolled 31 patients affected by ED (Group A; age 52.83 ± 11.89 years) and 31 healthy adults (Group B; age 49.14 ± 13.63 years). Fasting blood samples were taken for each subject. ED was assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). IIEF-5 mean score was significantly lower in Group A than in Group B (10.71 ± 4.24 versus 23.32 ± 1.33, p < .001). Compared to Group B, Group A also showed significantly lower serum FA levels (5.11 ± 1.79 versus 7.9 ± 3.55 ng/ml, p < .001) and significantly higher serum Hcys levels (13.61 ± 3.55 versus 9.17 ± 2.32 µmol/L, p < .001). No significant correlation was observed between Hcys and FA both groups. Our results showed a significant association among ED, FA deficiency and hyperomocisteinemia. Lack of correlation between FA and Hcys suggests that FA deficit may directly impair EF."
"Altered immune cell phenotype and chronic inflammation are key features shared by various chronic diseases. Evidence from nutritional interventions aimed at alleviating inflammation could be a promising approach for the prevention of adverse health outcomes. We therefore aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to summarize the recent evidence on the effects of dietary patterns on inflammatory and immune-related biomarkers in humans. PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases were searched for publications up to October 2020. In total, 22 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The Mediterranean diet appeared as the dietary pattern that showed the most prominent reductions of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 [mean difference (MD): –1.07 pg/mL (95% CI: –1.94, –0.20); I2: 96%], IL-1β [MD: –0.46 pg/mL (95% CI: –0.66, –0.25); I2: 0%], and C-reactive protein [MD: –1.00 mg/L (95% CI: –2.02, 0.01); I2: 100%]. No substantial effects were observed for the additional dietary patterns studied in intervention research, including the Dietary Adherence to Stop Hypertension diet, and the vegetarian or vegan diets. Future large-scale multifactorial intervention studies are warranted to allow direct comparison of various dietary patterns in relation to a range of biomarkers reflecting multiple inflammatory and immune-related pathways.","MP: Background & aims: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prevalent and persistent symptom from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer. The Mediterranean-style dietary pattern (MED-diet) offers a plausible mechanism to mitigate CRF through reducing inflammation and improving body composition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week MED-diet, compared to usual care, on CRF and quality of life in men with prostate cancer treated with ADT. Methods: Twenty-three men (65.9 ± 7.8 years; body mass index: 29.6 ± 2.7 kg/m2; ADT duration: 33.8 ± 35.6 months) receiving ADT for ≥3 months were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12-weeks of usual care or the MED-diet involving six individualised nutrition consults. Primary outcomes included CRF [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale (FACIT-F) and quality of life [FACIT-General (FACIT-G)], secondary outcomes included body mass/composition and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentrations measured at baseline, 8-weeks and 12 weeks. Intervention feasibility was measured by intervention safety, study completion rate, consult attendance, and adherence to the MED-diet through the Mediterranean-diet adherence screener (MEDAS). Intention to treat linear mixed models were used to determine changes in outcomes between the MED-diet and usual care at baseline, 8-weeks and 12-weeks. Results: The MED-diet improved CRF (FACIT-F) at 8-weeks [+4.8 (0.0, 9.8); P = 0.05] and 12-weeks [+7.2 (2.2, 12.0); P = 0.005], quality of life (FACIT-G) at 12-weeks [+9.2 (2.7, 15.8); P = 0.006], reduced total body mass at 8-weeks [−2.51 kg (−4.25, −0.78); P = 0.005] and 12-weeks [-2.97 kg (−4.71, −1.25); P = 0.001], lean mass at 8-weeks [−1.50 kg (−2.91, −0.10); P = 0.036], and IL-8 at 8-weeks [-0.18 ng/ml (−0.34, −0.02); P = 0.029] compared to usual care. The MED-diet demonstrated zero adverse events, 91% study completion, 100% attendance, and 81% adherence to the MEDAS. Conclusion: The MED-diet is safe and feasible, and has the potential to improve CRF and quality of life in overweight men treated with ADT compared to usual care. Further exploration of the MED-diet is warranted in a larger powered sample size to consolidate these findings.   MP: Background: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a Mediterranean-type diet as one of three healthful eating patterns. However, only one previous trial has evaluated the effects of a Mediterranean diet intervention in a US sample population. Methods: To address this gap, we conducted a pilot, non-blinded, 8-week randomized controlled trial on the comparative efficacy of consumption of a Mediterranean diet or a diet supplemented with fish oil, walnuts, and grape juice versus controls. Participants (overweight or obese US adults; 73% female and mean age 51 years) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Mediterranean diet; (2) habitual high-fat American-type diet supplemented with fish oil, walnuts, and grape juice; or (3) habitual high-fat American-type diet (controls). Intent-to-treat analysis of within-subject differences (Student's paired t-test or Wilcoxon sign ranks test) and between-subject differences (mixed-effects models with a group-by-time interaction term, adjusted for baseline health outcome) was conducted. Results: Participants in the Mediterranean diet arm (n = 11) had significantly greater weight loss despite no significant change in total caloric intake, and lower plasma cystine, indicative of decreased oxidative stress, compared to controls (n = 9) at both 4 and 8 weeks. Compared to controls, they also had significantly lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 4 weeks. Participants in the supplement arm (n = 10) had significantly lower adiponectin levels compared to controls at 4 weeks. No significant improvements in endothelial function or inflammatory biomarkers were observed in either intervention group compared to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest that adopting a dietary pattern reflecting a Mediterranean diet improves weight and cardio-metabolic health among overweight or obese US adults, and may be more beneficial than supplementing habitual American diets with fish oil, walnuts, and grape juice.   MP: Background & aims Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and with increased production of adhesion molecules. The present work examined the effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on soluble cellular adhesion molecules in individuals with AO. Methods Ninety subjects with AO without cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group and were instructed to follow a Mediterranean-style diet for two months. Intervention group followed a specific relevant food plan with close dietetic supervision and provision of basic foods. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), sP and sE-selectin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. Results Subjects in the intervention group increased their intake of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and alcohol compared to controls, while decreased their intake of saturated fat. Although there was a significant decrease in CRP, sP-selectin and in sE-selectin in the intervention group, and an increase in sVCAM-1 in the control group, between-group analysis showed no statistically significant differences. There were also no significant changes in sICAM-1, and IL-6 levels after intervention. Conclusions Mediterranean-type diet for two months combined with close dietetic supervision showed a beneficial tendency towards the down-regulation of some markers of vascular inflammation, although the comparison between groups after the intervention did not reach statistical significance. A longer period of dietary intervention may be required to further support these changes.  MP: Objectives To investigate the effects of a Mediterranean type diet on patients with osteoarthritis (OA).  Participants Ninety-nine volunteers with OA (aged 31 - 90 years) completed the study (83% female).  Setting Southeast of England, UK.  Design Participants were randomly allocated to the dietary intervention (DIET, n = 50) or control (CON, n = 49). The DIET group were asked to follow a Mediterranean type diet for 16 weeks whereas the CON group were asked to follow their normal diet.  Measurements All participants completed an Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS2) pre-, mid- and post- study period. A subset of participants attended a clinic at the start and end of the study for assessment of joint range of motion, ROM (DIET = 33, CON = 28), and to provide blood samples (DIET = 29, CON = 25) for biomarker analysis (including serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP) (a marker of cartilage degradation) and a panel of other relevant biomarkers including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines).  Results There were no differences between groups in the response of any AIMS2 components and most biomarkers (p > 0.05), except the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α, which decreased in the DIET group (~47%, p = 0.010). sCOMP decreased in the DIET group by 1 U/L (~8%, p = 0.014). There was a significant improvement in knee flexion and hip rotation ROM in the DIET group (p < 0.05).  Conclusions The average reduction in sCOMP in the DIET group (1 U/L) represents a meaningful change, but the longer term effects require further study.  MP: The Mediterranean diet offers a range of health benefits. However, previous studies indicate that the restricted consumption of red meat in the diet may affect long-term sustainability in non-Mediterranean countries. A 24-week randomised controlled parallel cross-over design compared a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 2–3 serves per week of fresh, lean pork (MedPork) with a low-fat control diet (LF). Thirty-three participants at risk of CVD followed each intervention for 8 weeks, with an 8-week washout period separating interventions. The primary outcome was home-measured systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), body composition and dietary adherence. During the MedPork intervention, participants achieved high adherence to dietary guidelines. Compared with the MedPork intervention, the LF intervention led to greater reductions in weight (Δ = −0·65; 95 % CI −0·04, −1·25 kg, P = 0·04), BMI (Δ = −0·25; 95 % CI −0·03, −0·47 kg/m2, P = 0·01) and waist circumference (Δ = −1·40; 95 % CI −0·45, −2·34 cm, P < 0·01). No significant differences were observed for blood pressure, lipids, glucose, insulin or CRP. These findings indicate that Australians are capable of adhering to a Mediterranean diet with 2–3 weekly serves of fresh, lean pork. Larger intervention studies are now required to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the diet in populations with elevated blood pressure.  MP: A higher dietary inflammatory index (DII®) score is associated with inflammation and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). We hypothesized that a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) intervention would reduce DII score. We assessed dietary data from a randomized controlled trial comparing 6-month MedDiet versus low-fat diet intervention, in patients with CHD. We aimed to determine the DII scores of the prescribed diets' model meal plans, followed by whether dietary intervention led to lower (i.e., more anti-inflammatory) DII scores and consequently lower high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (hs-IL-6). DII scores were calculated from 7-day food diaries. The MedDiet meal plan had a markedly lower DII score than the low-fat diet meal plan (−4.55 vs. -0.33, respectively). In 56 participants who completed the trial (84% male, mean age 62 ± 9 years), the MedDiet group significantly reduced DII scores at 6 months (n = 27; −0.40 ± 3.14 to −1.74 ± 2.81, P =.008) and the low-fat diet group did not change (n = 29; −0.17 ± 2.27 to 0.05 ± 1.89, P =.65). There was a significant post-intervention adjusted difference in DII score between groups (compared to low-fat, MedDiet decreased by −1.69 DII points; P =.004). When compared to the low-fat diet, the MedDiet non-significantly reduced hs-IL-6 (−0.32 pg/mL, P =.29) and increased hs-CRP (+0.09 mg/L, P =.84). These findings demonstrated that MedDiet intervention significantly reduced DII scores compared to a low-fat diet. However, in this small cohort of patients with CHD this did not translate to a significant improvement in measured inflammatory markers. The effect of improvement in DII with MedDiet should be tested in larger intervention trials and observational cohorts.   MP: Background The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) offers benefits to cardiovascular health but may not meet Western recommendations for calcium and dairy intake, which could impede long-term adoption.  Objective The current study aimed to determine the effect of a MedDiet supplemented with dairy foods on cardiovascular risk factors.  Design A randomized, controlled, crossover design compared a MedDiet with 3–4 daily servings of dairy (MedDairy) and a low-fat (LF) control diet. Forty-one participants aged ≥45 y and at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomly allocated to their first intervention, either the MedDairy or LF diet. Participants followed each intervention for 8 wk, and an 8-wk washout period separated interventions. The primary outcome was home-measured systolic blood pressure (SBP) assessed in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Secondary outcomes included clinic-measured blood pressure (morning), body composition, blood lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma glucose, serum insulin, and the Framingham Risk Score.  Results Compared with the LF intervention, the MedDairy intervention resulted in a significantly lower morning SBP (mean difference: −1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI: −2.8, −0.4 mm Hg; P = 0.01), lower morning diastolic blood pressure (mean difference: −1.0; 95% CI: −1.7, −0.2 mm Hg; P = 0.01) and clinic SBP (mean difference: −3.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: −6.4, −0.7 mm Hg; P = 0.02), significantly higher HDL cholesterol (mean difference: 0.04 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06 mmol/L; P < 0.01), lower triglycerides (mean difference: = −0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI: −0.08, −0.01 mmol/L; P < 0.01), and lower ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (mean difference: −0.4; 95% CI: −0.6, −0.2; P < 0.001). No effects were observed for other outcome measures.  Conclusions Following a MedDiet with additional dairy foods led to significant changes in markers of cardiovascular risk over 8 wk. The MedDiet supplemented with dairy may be appropriate for an improvement in cardiovascular risk factors in a population at risk of CVD.  MP: Background. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a powerful risk factor for atherosclerosis (AT). The crucial method of minimizing the development of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations is lifestyle modifications, including following a healthy diet. The aim of the study was to check if the Central European Diet (CED) could be an alternative to the Mediterranean Diet (MED) in the prevention of AT in patients with a risk of MS. Methods. The randomized, single-blind nutritional trial involved 144 obese women with a risk of MS. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups and followed MED (n = 72) or CED (n = 72) for 16 weeks. The concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) were measured before and after nutritional intervention. Results. In both studied groups, the concentrations of hs-CRP decreased significantly after the nutritional intervention (CED: p = 0.0107; MED: p = 0.0002). The ADMA levels were significantly lower after nutritional intervention in the CED group (p = 0.0187) but not in the MED group (p = 0.8354). However, the observed changes of hs-CRP concentrations (Δhs-CRP) and ADMA levels (ΔADMA) were not different between the groups (p = 0.5307 and p = 0.0905, respectively). Conclusion. In the Central European post-menopausal obese population, a well-designed, energy-restricted diet with the use of food items traditional for the region (CED) could be a good alternative to MED in terms of AT prevention.  MP: High dietary polyphenol intake is associated with reduced all-cause mortality and a lower incidence of cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. The aim of the present substudy of the PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (Prevention with Mediterranean diet; PREDIMED) trial was to analyse the relationship between polyphenol intake measured by total urinary polyphenol excretion (TPE), and circulating inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors in elderly individuals. A substudy of 1139 high-risk participants was carried out within the PREDIMED trial. The subjects were randomly assigned to a low-fat control diet or to two Mediterranean diets, supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts. Dietary intake, anthropometric data, clinical and laboratory assessments, including inflammatory biomarkers, and urinary TPE were measured at baseline and after the one-year intervention. Participants in the highest tertile of changes in urinary TPE (T3) showed significantly lower plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers [vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (–9.47 ng ml–1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (–14.71 ng ml–1), interleukin 6 (–1.21 pg ml–1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (–7.05 pg ml–1) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (–3.36 pg ml–1)] than those inthe lowest tertile (T1, P < 0.02; all). A significant inverse correlation existed between urinary TPE and the plasma concentration of\VCAM-1 (r = –0.301; P < 0.001). In addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in parallel with increasing urinary TPE (T3 vs. T1) (P < 0.005 and P = 0.004, respectively). Increases in polyphenol intake measured as urinary TPE are associated with decreased inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of polyphenols. In addition, high polyphenol intake improves cardiovascular risk factors– mainly BP and the lipid profile.  MP: Objective. To evaluate the long-Term effects of a Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) intervention on the plasma concentrations of inflammatory and plaque stability-related molecules in elderly people at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Design and Setting. 66 participants from primary care centers affiliated with the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona were randomized into 3 groups: MeDiet plus extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts and a low-fat diet (LFD). At baseline and at 3 and 5 years, we evaluated the changes in the plasma concentrations of 24 inflammatory biomarkers related to the different stages of the atherosclerotic process by Luminex®. Results. At 3 and 5 years, both MeDiet groups showed a significant reduction of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1β (P<0.05; all) compared to LFD. IL-1β, IL-5, IL-7, IL-12p70, IL-18, TNF-α, IFN-γ, GCSF, GMCSF, and ENA78 (P<0.05; all) only decreased in the MeDiet+EVOO group and E-selectin and sVCAM-1 (P<0.05; both) in the MeDiet+nuts group. Conclusions. Long-Term adherence to MeDiet decreases the plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers related to different steps of atheroma plaque development in elderly persons at high cardiovascular risk.   MP: Background: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has demonstrated short-term anti-inflammatory effects, but little is known about its long-term immunomodulatory properties.  Objective: Our goal was to assess the long-term effects of the MedDiet on inflammatory markers related to atherogenesis in adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the effects of a low-fat diet (LFD).  Methods: We randomly assigned 165 high-risk participants (one-half men; mean age: 66 y) without overt CVD to 1 of 3 diets: a MedDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a MedDiet supplemented with nuts, or an LFD. Follow-up data were collected at 3 and 5 y. Repeated-measures ANOVA, adjusted for potential confounding variables, was used to evaluate changes in diet adherence, CVD risk factors, and inflammatory variables.  Results: The 2 MedDiet groups achieved a high degree of adherence to the intervention, and the LFD group had reduced energy intake from fat by 13% by 5 y. Compared with baseline, at 3 and 5 y, both MedDiet groups had significant reductions of ≥16% in plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (P ≤ 0.04), whereas there were no significant changes in the LFD group. The reductions in CD49d and CD40 expressions in T lymphocytes and monocytes at 3 y were ≥16% greater in both MedDiet groups than were the changes in the LFD group (P < 0.001) at 3 y. Compared with baseline, at 3 y, the MedDiet groups had increased HDL-cholesterol (≥8%) and decreased blood pressure (>4%) and total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride (≥8%) concentrations. At 5 y, concentrations of glucose (13%) and glycated hemoglobin (8%) had increased with the LFD.  Conclusions: The MedDiet participants had lower cellular and plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers related to atherosclerosis at 3 and 5 y. This anti-inflammatory role of the MedDiet could explain in part the long-term cardioprotective effect of the MedDiet against CVD.  MP: Mediterranean-style diets provide cardiovascular benefits and increase insulin sensitivity. There is little evidence that adherence to Mediterranean diet may influence the levels of the inflammatory milieu in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess whether Mediterranean diet influences both C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and whether adherence to Mediterranean diet affects their circulating levels. In a two-arm, single-center trial, 215 men and women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were randomized to a Mediterranean diet (n = 108, 54 males and 54 females) or a low-fat diet (n = 107, 52 males and 55 females), with a total follow-up of 8.1 years. At baseline visit and at 1 year, body weight, HOMA index, CRP, and adiponectin and its fractions were assessed. Adherence to the diets was assessed by calculating the Mediterranean-diet score. At 1 year, CPR fell by 37 % and adiponectin rose by 43 % in the Mediterranean diet group, while remaining unchanged in the low-fat diet group. The pattern of adiponectin fractions (high and non-high molecular weight) showed a response similar to that of total adiponectin. Diabetic patients with the highest scores (6–9 points) of adherence to Mediterranean diet had lower circulating CRP level and higher circulating total adiponectin levels than the diabetic patients who scored <3 points on the scale (P = 0.001). The results of this randomized controlled trial demonstrate that Mediterranean diet cools down the inflammatory milieu of type 2 diabetes.  MP: Scope Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene have been associated with cardiometabolic conditions such as obesity and dyslipidemia. Our aim was to examine whether the chronic consumption of two healthy diets interacts with SNPs of the CLOCK gene in order to improve lipid metabolism and inflammation status in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).  Methods and results The diets were low-fat (LF) diet and Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). CLOCK SNPs (rs1801260, rs3749474, rs4580704) and the study procedures were performed in 897 patients from the CORDIOPREV clinical trial. After 12 months of intervention, we found significant gene–diet interactions between rs4580704 SNP and the LF diet. Specifically, major allele carriers C/C displayed a greater decrease in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and a significant increase in HDL/apolipoprotein A1 ratio (p = 0.029) than minor G allele carriers (G/G + C/G). No other gene–diet interactions were observed in this research.  Conclusion These results suggest that rs4580704 SNP interacts with the LF diet improving inflammation status and dyslipidemia related with CHD. The shift toward “personalized nutrition” based on gene–nutrient interactions may be suitable for promoting cardiovascular health in patients with CHD.  MP: The hypothesis that habitual fat intake, the IL6 genotype, the Mediterranean diet or the central European diet for 16 weeks affect biomarkers of inflammation in centrally obese postmenopausal women, was tested in a randomized controlled trial. Dietary intake was assessed using a three-day food diary. Lipid parameters were measured using a Beckman Coulter AU analyzer. Transcription of TNF and IL6 genes was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using real-time PCR. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL6) were measured with ELISA. rs1800795 polymorphism of IL6 was analyzed using hydrolyzing probes. Higher energy intake from fat was associated with higher IL6 levels (p < 0.05). Significantly (p < 0.01) lower total cholesterol (T-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations were observed in the GG IL6 rs1800795 genotype group. Both diets significantly (p < 0.001) decreased TNFα concentrations. Neither IL6 gene transcription levels nor blood IL6 concentrations were affected by them. Our findings confirm that habitual fat intake may affect inflammation. The rs1800795 IL6 polymorphism alone did not significantly affect body weight or body composition in aimed group, but C-allele carriers had higher levels of T-C and LDL-C. This polymorphism did not affect inflammation. Both diets may lead to a decrease in TNFα concentration.  MP: Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two interventions in breakfast with different fatty acid content on metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in individuals at different cardiovascular risk levels. Methods This crossover clinical trial included 80 overweight participants who were grouped according to the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The participants received two isocaloric breakfast interventions for 4 wk, with a 2-wk washout. The “Brazilian” breakfast was enriched with saturated fat, whereas the “modified” meal was enriched with unsaturated fatty acids and fibers. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare dietary data, and Student's t or Wilcoxon tests were used to compare clinical and inflammatory variables. A χ2 test was employed to compare frequencies. Results Frequencies of MetS increased after the Brazilian breakfast and decreased after the modified meal. Significant reduction in mean values of WC and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and elevation in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were detected at the end of the modified intervention. Participants with or without the MetS exhibited contrasting responses to the modified breakfast: respectively, significant changes in DBP levels (−3.7 ± 6.9 versus −0.5 ± 6.9 mm Hg; P < 0.05), plasma glucose (−3 ± 7.3 versus 3 ± 7.4 mg/dL; P < 0.05), and apolipoprotein-B (−0.1 ± 0.6 versus 0.2 ± 0.3 mg/mL; P < 0.05), interferon-γ (−0.6 ± 1.2 versus 0.1 ± 1.3 pg/mL; P < 0.05), and tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations (0.4 ± 3.6 versus −0.8 ± 2.8 pg/mL; P < 0.05) were observed. Conclusions Dietary intervention of small magnitude, for a short period, was able to improve traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and inflammatory markers, as well as the frequency of MetS. Responses to dietary interventions of individuals at different levels of cardiovascular risk should be examined through different biomarkers.  MP: BaBackground and aims: Aim of this study involved assessment of the intensive intervention concerning lifestyle based on the DASH diet model on plasma concentration of CXCL4 chemokine among patients with coronary atherosclerosis. Methods and results: The Dietary Intervention to Stop Coronary Atherosclerosis in Computed Tomography Study randomized patients with stable CAD to an interventional group (n = 41), where DASH diet was implemented and the control group (n = 40) without dietary intervention. Dietary counselling was provided to DASH group during all 6 control visits within 6 months of observation. During the study, body weight and body composition were controlled using the bioimpedance method. CXCL4 concentration was determined with the use of ELISA test. Within the DASH group, a significant decrease in body weight, a decrease in high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (−0.32 ± 2.8 mg/l; p < 0.05), as well as a decrease in CXCL4 concentration (−3.35 ± 3.4 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) were observed. Occurring changes were not statistically significant within the control group. Conclusions: DASH diet lessens CXCL4 concentration among patients with a stable CAD, however, further research is necessary in order to confirm aforementioned results and evaluate the impact on atherosclerotic plaque.

"Background The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive development in many fields, including the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by mass spectrometry. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of mass spectrometry diagnostic tests developed so far, across a wide range of biological matrices, and additionally to assess risks of bias and applicability in studies published to date.  Method 23 retrospective observational cohort studies were included in the systematic review using the PRISMA-DTA framework, with a total of 2858 COVID-19 positive participants and 2544 controls. Risks of bias and applicability were assessed via a QUADAS-2 questionnaire. A meta-analysis was also performed focusing on sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and Youden's Index, in addition to assessing heterogeneity.  Findings Sensitivity averaged 0.87 in the studies reviewed herein (interquartile range 0.81–0.96) and specificity 0.88 (interquartile range 0.82–0.98), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic summary curve of 0.93. By subgroup, the best diagnostic results were achieved by viral proteomic analyses of nasopharyngeal swabs and metabolomic analyses of plasma and serum. The performance of other sampling matrices (breath, sebum, saliva) was less good, indicating that these protocols are currently insufficiently mature for clinical application.  Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates the potential for mass spectrometry and ‘omics in achieving accurate test results for COVID-19 diagnosis, but also highlights the need for further work to optimize and harmonize practice across laboratories before these methods can be translated to clinical applications.","MP: Rapid diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection still remains a major challenge. A multi-omic approach was adopted to analyze the respiratory specimens of 20 SARS-CoV-2-positive, 20 negative and 15 H1N1 pdm 2009 positive cases. Increased basal level of MX1 (MX dynamin-like GTPase 1) and WARS (tryptophan-tRNA ligase) correlated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and its outcome. These markers were further validated in 200 suspects. MX1>30pg/ml and WARS>25ng/ml segregated virus positives [AUC = 94% CI: (0.91–0.97)] and severe patients [AUC>0.85%]. Our results documented significant increase in immune activation; metabolic reprograming and decrease in oxygen transport, wound healing and others linked proteins and metabolites in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Multi-omics profiling correlated with viremia and segregated asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. Additionally, we identified increased respiratory pathogens (Burkholderiales, Klebsiella pneumonia) and decreased lactobacillus salivarius (FDR<0.05) in COVID-19 specimens. In conclusion, increased basal MX1 and WARS levels correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection and could aid in the identification of patient's predisposed to higher severity.  MP: Coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early, sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely recognized as the critical point in responding to the ongoing outbreak. Currently, the diagnosis is based on molecular real time RT-PCR techniques, although their implementation is being threatened due to the extraordinary demand for supplies worldwide. That is why the development of alternative and / or complementary tests becomes so relevant. Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry technology combined with machine learning algorithms, for the detection of COVID-19 positive and negative protein profiles directly from nasopharyngeal swabs samples. According to the preliminary results obtained, accuracy = 67.66 %, sensitivity = 61.76 %, specificity = 71.72 %, and although these parameters still need to be improved to be used as a screening technique, mass spectrometry-based methods coupled with multivariate analysis showed that it is an interesting tool that deserves to be explored as a complementary diagnostic approach due to the low cost and fast performance. However, further steps, such as the analysis of a large number of samples, should be taken in consideration to determine the applicability of the method developed.  MP: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS CoV-2 is ongoing and a serious threat to global public health. It is essential to detect the disease quickly and immediately to isolate the infected individuals. Nevertheless, the current widely used PCR and immunoassay-based methods suffer from false negative results and delays in diagnosis. Herein, a high-throughput serum peptidome profiling method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is developed for efficient detection of COVID-19. We analyzed the serum samples from 146 COVID-19 patients and 152 control cases (including 73 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical symptoms, 33 tuberculosis patients, and 46 healthy individuals). After MS data processing and feature selection, eight machine learning methods were used to build classification models. A logistic regression machine learning model with 25 feature peaks achieved the highest accuracy (99%), with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%, for the detection of COVID-19. This result demonstrated a great potential of the method for screening, routine surveillance, and diagnosis of COVID-19 in large populations, which is an important part of the pandemic control.  MP: The outbreak of COVID-19 has created an unprecedent global crisis. While the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard method for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infection, alternative high-throughput diagnostic tests are of a significant value to meet universal testing demands. Here, we describe a new design of the MasSpec Pen technology integrated to electrospray ionization (ESI) for direct analysis of clinical swabs and investigate its use for COVID-19 screening. The redesigned MasSpec Pen system incorporates a disposable sampling device refined for uniform and efficient analysis of swab tips via liquid extraction directly coupled to an ESI source. Using this system, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs from 244 individuals including symptomatic COVID-19 positive, symptomatic negative, and asymptomatic negative individuals, enabling rapid detection of rich lipid profiles. Two statistical classifiers were generated based on the lipid information acquired. Classifier 1 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive from asymptomatic PCR-negative individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 76.6%, and specificity of 86.6%, and validation set accuracy of 89.6%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 85.3%. Classifier 2 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive patients from negative individuals including symptomatic PCR-negative patients with moderate to severe symptoms and asymptomatic individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4%, specificity of 77.21%, and sensitivity of 81.8%. Collectively, this study suggests that the lipid profiles detected directly from nasopharyngeal swabs using MasSpec Pen-ESI mass spectrometry (MS) allow fast (under a minute) screening of the COVID-19 disease using minimal operating steps and no specialized reagents, thus representing a promising alternative high-throughput method for screening of COVID-19.  MP: Background There is an urgent need to rapidly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory conditions, including influenza, at first-presentation. Point-of-care tests not requiring laboratory- support will speed diagnosis and protect health-care staff. We studied the feasibility of using breath-analysis to distinguish these conditions with near-patient gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Methods Independent observational prevalence studies at Edinburgh, UK, and Dortmund, Germany, recruited adult patients with possible COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Participants gave a single breath-sample for VOC analysis by GC-IMS. COVID-19 infection was identified by transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) of oral/nasal swabs together with clinical-review. Following correction for environmental contaminants, potential COVID-19 breath-biomarkers were identified by multi-variate analysis and comparison to GC-IMS databases. A COVID-19 breath-score based on the relative abundance of a panel of volatile organic compounds was proposed and tested against the cohort data. Findings Ninety-eight patients were recruited, of whom 21/33 (63.6%) and 10/65 (15.4%) had COVID-19 in Edinburgh and Dortmund, respectively. Other diagnoses included asthma, COPD, bacterial pneumonia, and cardiac conditions. Multivariate analysis identified aldehydes (ethanal, octanal), ketones (acetone, butanone), and methanol that discriminated COVID-19 from other conditions. An unidentified-feature with significant predictive power for severity/death was isolated in Edinburgh, while heptanal was identified in Dortmund. Differentiation of patients with definite diagnosis (25 and 65) of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 was possible with 80% and 81.5% accuracy in Edinburgh and Dortmund respectively (sensitivity/specificity 82.4%/75%; area-under-the-receiver- operator-characteristic [AUROC] 0.87 95% CI 0.67 to 1) and Dortmund (sensitivity / specificity 90%/80%; AUROC 0.91 95% CI 0.87 to 1). Interpretation These two studies independently indicate that patients with COVID-19 can be rapidly distinguished from patients with other conditions at first healthcare contact. The identity of the marker compounds is consistent with COVID-19 derangement of breath-biochemistry by ketosis, gastrointestinal effects, and inflammatory processes. Development and validation of this approach may allow rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in the coming endemic flu seasons.  MP: Background The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed over two and a half million lives worldwide so far. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is perceived to be seasonally recurrent, and a rapid noninvasive biomarker to accurately diagnose patients early on in their disease course will be necessary to meet the operational demands for COVID-19 control in the coming years.  Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of exhaled breath volatile biomarkers in identifying patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, based on their underlying PCR status and clinical probability.  Methods A prospective, real-world, observational study was carried out, recruiting adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Breath samples were collected using a standard breath collection bag, modified with appropriate filters to comply with local infection control recommendations, and samples were analysed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS).  Results 81 patients were recruited between April 29 and July 10, 2020, of whom 52 out of 81 (64%) tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A regression analysis identified a set of seven exhaled breath features (benzaldehyde, 1-propanol, 3,6-methylundecane, camphene, beta-cubebene, iodobenzene and an unidentified compound) that separated PCR-positive patients with an area under the curve (AUC): 0.836, sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 85%.  Conclusions GC-MS-detected exhaled breath biomarkers were able to identify PCR-positive COVID-19 patients. External replication of these compounds is warranted to validate these results.  MP: Background Early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of the utmost importance but remains challenging. The objective of the current study was to characterize exhaled breath from mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19. Methods In this prospective observational study, we used real-time, online, proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry to perform a metabolomic analysis of expired air from adults undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit due to severe COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). • View related content for this article  Findings Between March 25th and June 25th, 2020, we included 40 patients with ARDS, of whom 28 had proven COVID-19. In a multivariate analysis, we identified a characteristic breathprint for COVID-19. We could differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS with accuracy of 93% (sensitivity: 90%, specificity: 94%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0·94-0·98, after cross-validation). The four most prominent volatile compounds in COVID-19 patients were methylpent-2-enal, 2,4-octadiene 1-chloroheptane, and nonanal. Interpretation The real-time, non-invasive detection of methylpent-2-enal, 2,4-octadiene 1-chloroheptane, and nonanal in exhaled breath may identify ARDS patients with COVID-19.  MP: COVID-19 is still placing a heavy health and financial burden worldwide. Impairment in patient screening and risk management plays a fundamental role on how governments and authorities are directing resources, planning reopening, as well as sanitary countermeasures, especially in regions where poverty is a major component in the equation. An efficient diagnostic method must be highly accurate, while having a cost-effective profile. We combined a machine learning-based algorithm with mass spectrometry to create an expeditious platform that discriminate COVID-19 in plasma samples within minutes, while also providing tools for risk assessment, to assist healthcare professionals in patient management and decision-making. A cross-sectional study enrolled 815 patients (442 COVID-19, 350 controls and 23 COVID-19 suspicious) from three Brazilian epicenters from April to July 2020. We were able to elect and identify 19 molecules related to the disease’s pathophysiology and several discriminating features to patient’s health-related outcomes. The method applied for COVID-19 diagnosis showed specificity >96% and sensitivity >83%, and specificity >80% and sensitivity >85% during risk assessment, both from blinded data. Our method introduced a new approach for COVID-19 screening, providing the indirect detection of infection through metabolites and contextualizing the findings with the disease’s pathophysiology. The pairwise analysis of biomarkers brought robustness to the model developed using machine learning algorithms, transforming this screening approach in a tool with great potential for real-world application.  MP: The metabolic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on human blood plasma were characterized using multiplatform metabolic phenotyping with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Quantitative measurements of lipoprotein subfractions, α-1-acid glycoprotein, glucose, and biogenic amines were made on samples from symptomatic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients who had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (n = 17) and from age- and gender-matched controls (n = 25). Data were analyzed using an orthogonal-projections to latent structures (OPLS) method and used to construct an exceptionally strong (AUROC = 1) hybrid NMR-MS model that enabled detailed metabolic discrimination between the groups and their biochemical relationships. Key discriminant metabolites included markers of inflammation including elevated α-1-acid glycoprotein and an increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. There was also an abnormal lipoprotein, glucose, and amino acid signature consistent with diabetes and coronary artery disease (low total and HDL Apolipoprotein A1, low HDL triglycerides, high LDL and VLDL triglycerides), plus multiple highly significant amino acid markers of liver dysfunction (including the elevated glutamine/glutamate and Fischer’s ratios) that present themselves as part of a distinct SARS-CoV-2 infection pattern. A multivariate training-test set model was validated using independent samples from additional SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and controls. The predictive model showed a sensitivity of 100% for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The breadth of the disturbed pathways indicates a systemic signature of SARS-CoV-2 positivity that includes elements of liver dysfunction, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and coronary heart disease risk that are consistent with recent reports that COVID-19 is a systemic disease affecting multiple organs and systems.  MP: Improved methods are required for investigating the systemic metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and patient stratification for precision treatment. We aimed to develop an effective method using lipid profiles for discriminating between SARS-CoV-2 infection, healthy controls, and non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections. Targeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry lipid profiling was performed on discovery (20 SARS-CoV-2-positive; 37 healthy controls; 22 COVID-19 symptoms but SARS-CoV-2negative) and validation (312 SARS-CoV-2-positive; 100 healthy controls) cohorts. Orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and Kruskal–Wallis tests were applied to establish discriminant lipids, significance, and effect size, followed by logistic regression to evaluate classification performance. OPLS-DA reported separation of SARS-CoV-2 infection from healthy controls in the discovery cohort, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.000. A refined panel of discriminant features consisted of six lipids from different subclasses (PE, PC, LPC, HCER, CER, and DCER). Logistic regression in the discovery cohort returned a training ROC AUC of 1.000 (sensitivity = 1.000, specificity = 1.000) and a test ROC AUC of 1.000. The validation cohort produced a training ROC AUC of 0.977 (sensitivity = 0.855, specificity = 0.948) and a test ROC AUC of 0.978 (sensitivity = 0.948, specificity = 0.922). The lipid panel was also able to differentiate SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms (specificity = 0.818). Lipid profiling and multivariate modelling revealed a signature offering mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2, with strong predictive power, and the potential to facilitate effective diagnosis and clinical management.  MP: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for testing - for diagnosis and prognosis - as well as for investigation into the impact of the disease on the host metabolism. Sebum sampling has the potential to support both needs by looking at what the virus does to us, rather than looking for the virus itself. Methods: In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 COVID-19 positive and 37 COVID-19 negative) by gauze swab. Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, identifying 998 reproducible features. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the resulting feature set. Findings: Lipid levels were depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia; p-values of 0·022 and 0·015 were obtained for triglycerides and ceramides respectively, with effect sizes of 0·44 and 0·57. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis showed separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants with sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 68%, improving to 79% and 83% respectively when controlled for confounding comorbidities. Interpretation: COVID-19 dysregulates many areas of metabolism; in this work we show that the skin lipidome can be added to the list. Given that samples can be provided quickly and painlessly, we conclude that sebum is worthy of future consideration for clinical sampling.  MP: As the current COVID-19 pandemic progresses, more symptoms and signals related to how the disease manifests in the human body arise in the literature. Skin lesions and coagulopathies may be confounding factors on routine care and patient management. We analyzed the metabolic and lipidic profile of the skin from COVID-19 patients using imprints in silica plates as a non-invasive alternative, in order to better understand the biochemical disturbances caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the skin. One hundred and one patients (64 COVID-19 positive patients and 37 control patients) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study from April 2020 to June 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19 in São Paulo, Brazil. Fourteen biomarkers were identified related to COVID-19 infection (7 increased and 7 decreased in COVID-19 patients). Remarkably, oleamide has shown promising performance, providing 79.0% of sensitivity on a receiver operating characteristic curve model. Species related to coagulation and immune system maintenance such as phosphatidylserines were decreased in COVID-19 patients; on the other hand, cytokine storm and immunomodulation may be affected by molecules increased in the COVID-19 group, particularly primary fatty acid amides and N-acylethanolamines, which are part of the endocannabinoid system. Our results show that skin imprints may be a useful, noninvasive strategy for COVID-19 screening, by electing a pool of biomarkers with diagnostic potential.  MP: Currently, teaching and learning English for children as a second language is a matter of social concern. At what age is it appropriate to start teaching English to children, how to approach to achieve high efficiency is being studied by psychologists, educational administrators and educational institutions for children.Through the research problem, the author has pointed out the favorable psychological characteristics of preschool children when learning English and more, on the basis of research on age psychology, pedagogical psychology and practice teaching in preschool, the author has proposed measures to help 5-year-old children learn English as a second language effectively. Accordingly, it is necessary to make conclusions and recommendations for students’ parents, teachers, educational administrators, etc. to contribute to creating opportunities for children to approach English in the best way.  MP: Background The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to represent an ongoing global health issue given the potential for vaccine escape and the low likelihood of eliminating all reservoirs of the disease. Whilst diagnostic testing has progressed at pace, there is an unmet clinical need to develop tests that are prognostic, to triage the high volumes of patients arriving in hospital settings. Recent research has shown that serum metabolomics has potential for prognosis of disease progression. 1 In a hospital setting, collection of saliva samples is more convenient for both staff and patients, and therefore offers an alternative sampling matrix to serum. We demonstrate here for the first time that saliva metabolomics can reveal COVID-19 severity.  Methods 88 saliva samples were collected from hospitalised patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, alongside clinical metadata. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed using RT-PCR testing. COVID severity was classified using clinical descriptors first proposed by SR Knight et al. Metabolites were extracted from saliva samples and analysed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.  Results In this work, positive percent agreement of 1.00 between a PLS-DA metabolomics model and the clinical diagnosis of COVID severity was achieved. The negative percent agreement with the clinical severity diagnosis was also 1.00, for overall percent agreement of 1.00.  Conclusions This research demonstrates that liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry can identify salivary biomarkers capable of separating high severity COVID-19 patients from low severity COVID-19 patients in a small cohort study.  MP: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using RT–PCR and other advanced methods can achieve high accuracy. However, their application is limited in countries that lack sufficient resources to handle large-scale testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and machine learning analysis. This approach uses equipment and expertise commonly found in clinical laboratories in developing countries. We obtained mass spectra from a total of 362 samples (211 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 151 negative by RT–PCR) without prior sample preparation from three different laboratories. We tested two feature selection methods and six machine learning approaches to identify the top performing analysis approaches and determine the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The support vector machine model provided the highest accuracy (93.9%), with 7% false positives and 5% false negatives. Our results suggest that MALDI-MS and machine learning analysis can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab samples.  MP: The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 makes it essential to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic test so that carriers can be isolated at an early stage. Viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples by RT-PCR is currently considered the reference method although it is not recognized as a strong gold standard due to certain drawbacks. Here we develop a methodology combining the analysis of from human nasopharyngeal (NP) samples by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with the use of machine learning (ML). A total of 236 NP samples collected in two different viral transport media were analyzed with minimal sample preparation and the subsequent mass spectra data was used to build different ML models with two different techniques. The best model showed high performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, in all cases reaching values higher than 90%. Our results suggest that the analysis of NP samples by MALDI-TOF MS and ML is a simple, safe, fast and economic diagnostic test for COVID-19.  MP: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pressing public health systems around the world, and large population testing is a key step to control this pandemic disease. Here, we develop a high-throughput targeted proteomics assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptides directly from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. A modified magnetic particle-based proteomics approach implemented on a robotic liquid handler enables fully automated preparation of 96 samples within 4 hours. A TFC-MS system allows multiplexed analysis of 4 samples within 10 min, enabling the processing of more than 500 samples per day. We validate this method qualitatively (Tier 3) and quantitatively (Tier 1) using 985 specimens previously analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, and detect up to 84% of the positive cases with up to 97% specificity. The presented strategy has high sample stability and should be considered as an option for SARS-CoV-2 testing in large populations.  MP: More than a year after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, the need still exists for accurate, rapid, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic methods that yield high specificity and sensitivity towards the current and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains. Compared to the nasopharyngeal swabs, several studies have established saliva as a more amenable specimen type for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the limitations and high demand for COVID-19 testing, we employed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry in the analysis of 60 gargle samples from human donors and compared the resultant spectra against COVID-19 status. Several standards, including isolated human serum immunoglobulins, and controls, such as pre-COVID-19 saliva and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, were simultaneously analyzed to provide a relative view of the saliva and viral proteome as they would appear in this workflow. Five potential biomarker peaks were established that demonstrated high concordance with COVID-19 positive individuals. Overall, the agreement of these results with RT-qPCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs was ≥90% for the studied cohort, which consisted of young and largely asymptomatic student athletes. From a clinical standpoint, the results from this pilot study suggest that MALDI-ToF could be used to develop a relatively rapid and inexpensive COVID-19 assay.  "
"Objective The ameliorative effect of taurine on diabetes has received extensive attention in recent years. Despite promising data from animal studies, the efficacy of taurine supplementation in human studies has been inconsistent. We thus did a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effect of taurine supplement on glycemic indices, serum lipids, blood pressure, body composition in patients with diabetes.  Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, FDA.gov, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (published from inception to January 15, 2022; no language restrictions) about the effect of taurine supplement on diabetes. Values of Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) were determined for continuous outcomes.  Results Of 2206 identified studies, 5 randomized controlled trials were eligible and were included in our analysis (N = 209 participants). Compared with the control group, taurine could significantly reduce HbA1c (SMD −0.41[95% CI: −0.74, −0.09], p = 0.01), Fasting Blood Sugar (SMD − 1.28[95% CI: −2.42, −0.14], p = 0.03) and HOMA-IR (SMD − 0.64[95% CI: −1.22, −0.06], p = 0.03). In addition, taurine also reduced Insulin (SMD −0.48 [95% CI: −0.99, 0.03], p = 0.06) and TG (SMD −0.26 [95% CI: −0.55, 0.02], p = 0.07), but did not reach statistical significance.  Conclusions Taurine supplementation is beneficial in reducing glycemic indices, such as HbA1c, Fasting Blood Sugar, HOMA-IR in diabetic patients, but has no significant effect on serum lipids, blood pressure and body composition in diabetic patients. Taurine emerges as a new option for the management of patients with diabetes. Further studies are needed to understand the potential effect of taurine in diabetic patients.","MP: Objectives: Advanced glycation end products, along with methylglyoxal (MGO) as their precursor, play a major role in increased complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Taurine (2-aminoethanesulphonic acid), a conditionally essential amino acid, is found in most mammalian tissues. Taurine is known as an antiglycation compound. This study was designed to investigate the effects of taurine supplementation on metabolic profiles, pentosidine, MGO and soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products in patients with T2DM. Methods: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 46 patients with T2DM were randomly allocated into taurine and placebo groups. Participants received either 3,000 mg/day taurine or placebo for 8 weeks. Metabolic profiles, pentosidine, MGO and soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products levels were assessed after 12 h of fasting at baseline and completion of the clinical trial. Independent t test, paired t test, Pearson correlation and analysis of covariance were used for analysis. Results: The mean serum levels of fasting blood sugar (p=0.01), glycated hemoglobin (p=0.04), insulin (p=0.03), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (p=0.004), total cholesterol (p=0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.03) significantly were reduced in the taurine group at completion compared with the placebo group. In addition, after completion of the study, pentosidine (p=0.004) and MGO (p=0.006) were significantly reduced in the taurine group compared with the placebo group. Conclusions: The results of this trial show that taurine supplementation may decrease diabetes complications through improving glycemic control and advanced glycation end products.  MP: Type 1 diabetics have a well-recognised risk of accelerated cardiovascular disease. Even in the absence of clinical signs there are detectable abnormalities of conduit vessel function. Our group has previously reported reversal of endothelial dysfunction in diabetics with pravastatin. In young asymptomatic smokers, taurine supplementation has a beneficial impact on macrovascular function, assessed by FMD, and shows an up-regulation of nitric oxide from monocyte-endothelial cell interactions. We hypothesise that taurine supplementation reverses early endothelial abnormalities in young male type 1 diabetics, as assessed by applanation tonometry, brachial artery ultrasound and laser Doppler fluximetry. Asymptomatic, male diabetics (n=9) were scanned prior to treatment and then randomised in a double-blind cross-over fashion to receive either 2 weeks placebo or taurine. Control patients (n=10) underwent a baseline scan. Assessed diabetics had detectable, statistically significant abnormalities when compared with controls, in both arterial stiffness (augmentation index) and brachial artery reactivity (FMD). Both of these parameters were returned to control levels with 2 weeks taurine supplementation. In conclusion, 2 weeks taurine supplementation reverses early, detectable conduit vessel abnormalities in young male diabetics. This may have important implications in the long-term treatment of diabetic patients and their subsequent progression towards atherosclerotic disease.  MP: BACKGROUND: Usage of either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) with or without dual channel calcium blockers (DCCB) is the standard recommendation for prevention of progression of micro to macro albuminuria and diabetic nephropathy (DN); however, these agents have their limitations. Animal studies with taurine and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) have demonstrated additional reduction of microalbuminuria (MA). OBJECTIVES: To know whether the combination of NAC and taurine would additionally reduce MA and transforming growth factor ß (TGF ß) expression in T2 diabetics who are already on optimal doses of either ACEI or ARB and/or DCCB, and to know the effect of this combination on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), lipid parameters, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty diabetics, having MA, who were already on optimum doses of ARB or ACEI and or DCCB were recruited. Fifty were allocated to the test group and 30 were in the control group. All were examined with their height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and BP was measured initially and at the end of 3 months. The test group was administered NAC + taurine tablets, one tablet daily for 3 months and placebo was given to the control group. HbA1c, lipid profile, serum creatinine, MA, TGF ß and e-GFR were estimated before and on completion of the study. ANOVA and Pearson's correlation were employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Forty-one in the test group and 21 in the placebo group completed the study. The test group did show reduction in MA and TGF ß. MA reduced from 161.75 [+ or -] 120.38 mcg to 138.42 [+ or -] 153.60 mcg. TGF ß decreased from 15.69 [+ or -] 9.16 to 12.68 [+ or -] 8.02 and both were not statistically significant. There was no change in serum creatinine and e-GFR. The drug did not have any significant effect on lipids, HbA1c, and BP. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of NAC + taurine provides additional reduction in MA and TGF ß in those on ARB or ACEI with or without DCCB. The drug may thus be beneficial to those who have reached maximum reduction of MA with the other molecules. TGF ß reduction is also a bonus which may postpone nephropathy. Further studies with larger recruits and increased doses may show statistically significant results.  MP: Background: We aimed to investigate the effects of an 8-week total-body resistance exercise (TRX) suspension training intervention combined with taurine supplementation on body composition, blood glucose, and lipid markers in T2D females. Methods: Forty T2D middle-aged females (age: 53 ± 5 years, body mass = 84.3 ± 5.1 kg) were randomly assigned to four groups, TRX suspension training + placebo (TP; n = 10), TRX suspension training + taurine supplementation (TT; n = 10), taurine supplementation (T; n = 10), or control (C; n = 10). Body composition (body mass, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP)), blood glucose (fasting blood sugar (FBS)), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Insulin, and Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid markers (low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC)) were evaluated prior to and after interventions. Results: All three interventions significantly decreased body mass, BMI, and BFP with no changes between them for body mass and BMI; however, BFP changes in the TT group were significantly greater than all other groups. FBS was significantly reduced in TP and TT. Insulin concentrations’ decrement were significantly greater in all experimental groups compared to C; however, no between group differences were observed between TT, TP, and T. In regards to HOMA-IR, decreases in TT were significantly greater than all other groups TG, HbA1c, and LDL were reduced following all interventions. HDL values significantly increased only in the TT group, while TC significantly decreased in TP and TT groups. Changes in HbA1c, TG, HDL, and TC were significantly greater in the TT compared to all other groups. Conclusions: TRX training improved glycemic and lipid profiles, while taurine supplementation alone failed to show hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. Notably, the synergic effects of TRX training and taurine supplementation were shown in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, TG, TC, HDL, and BFP changes. Our outcomes suggest that TRX training + taurine supplementation may be an effective adjuvant therapy in individuals with T2D.  "
"Objectives To evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival (OS) using aggregate-level data from resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer (EC/GEJC) trials assessing therapies in (neo)adjuvant and perioperative settings.  Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify trials reporting OS and DFS, or compatible progression-free survival (PFS). Bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate correlation between the treatment effects on DFS/PFS and OS, and weighted linear regression models assuming trial sample sizes as weights were used to estimate surrogacy equations. The primary analysis consisted of trials across all treatment settings, and secondary analysis consisted of trials only in the adjuvant setting. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed to measure the stability and predictive accuracy of the surrogacy equations while surrogate threshold effects (STE)—the minimum treatment effect on DFS/PFS that would translate into a positive OS benefit—were derived to measure their usefulness.  Results The primary analysis included 26 trials. The estimated correlation coefficient between the hazard ratio (HR) of DFS/PFS (HRDFS/PFS) and HR of OS (HROS) was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70–0.90). The estimated surrogacy equation was log(HROS) = 0.80 × log(HRDFS/PFS) with a corresponding STE of 0.82. Reported HROS was within the 95% prediction interval of the predicted HROS from the model for more than 95% of the trials in the LOOCV, indicating a valid model. Secondary analysis included 7 trials with an estimated correlation coefficient of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.18–0.95). Through LOOCV, the surrogacy equation in the adjuvant setting was deemed valid.  Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that HRDFS/PFS —where DFS/PFS is defined as time from resection to disease recurrence (local, locoregional, or distant) or death—is correlated to HROS, and a valid and useful surrogate predictor for HROS in the neoadjuvant, perioperative, or adjuvant settings.","MP: Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery improves survival compared with surgery alone for patients with oesophageal cancer. The OE05 trial assessed whether increasing the duration and intensity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy further improved survival compared with the current standard regimen. Methods OE05 was an open-label, phase 3, randomised clinical trial. Patients with surgically resectable oesophageal adenocarcinoma classified as stage cT1N1, cT2N1, cT3N0/N1, or cT4N0/N1 were recruited from 72 UK hospitals. Eligibility criteria included WHO performance status 0 or 1, adequate respiratory, cardiac, and liver function, white blood cell count at least 3 × 109 cells per L, platelet count at least 100 × 109 platelets per L, and a glomerular filtration rate at least 60 mL/min. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) using a computerised minimisation program with a random element and stratified by centre and tumour stage, to receive two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF; two 3-weekly cycles of cisplatin [80 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1] and fluorouracil [1 g/m2 per day intravenously on days 1–4]) or four cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX; four 3-weekly cycles of epirubicin [50 mg/m2] and cisplatin [60 mg/m2] intravenously on day 1, and capecitabine [1250 mg/m2] daily throughout the four cycles) before surgery, stratified according to centre and clinical disease stage. Neither patients nor study staff were masked to treatment allocation. Two-phase oesophagectomy with two-field (abdomen and thorax) lymphadenectomy was done within 4–6 weeks of completion of chemotherapy. The primary outcome measure was overall survival, and primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (number 01852072) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00041262), and is completed. Findings Between Jan 13, 2005, and Oct 31, 2011, 897 patients were recruited and 451 were assigned to the CF group and 446 to the ECX group. By Nov 14, 2016, 327 (73%) of 451 patients in the CF group and 302 (68%) of 446 in the ECX group had died. Median survival was 23·4 months (95% CI 20·6–26·3) with CF and 26·1 months (22·5–29·7) with ECX (hazard ratio 0·90 (95% CI 0·77–1·05, p=0·19). No unexpected chemotherapy toxicity was seen, and neutropenia was the most commonly reported event (grade 3 or 4 neutropenia: 74 [17%] of 446 patients in the CF group vs 101 [23%] of 441 people in the ECX group). The proportions of patients with postoperative complications (224 [56%] of 398 people for whom data were available in the CF group and 233 [62%] of 374 in the ECX group; p=0·089) were similar between the two groups. One patient in the ECX group died of suspected treatment-related neutropenic sepsis. Interpretation Four cycles of neoadjuvant ECX compared with two cycles of CF did not increase survival, and cannot be considered standard of care. Our study involved a large number of centres and detailed protocol with comprehensive prospective assessment of health-related quality of life in a patient population confined to people with adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction (Siewert types 1 and 2). Alternative chemotherapy regimens and neoadjuvant chemoradiation are being investigated to improve outcomes for patients with oesophageal carcinoma. Funding Cancer Research UK and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London.   MP: Background: Patients with oesophageal/gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (EAC) not showing early metabolic response (EMR) to chemotherapy have poorer survival and histological response rates <5%. We investigated whether tailoring neoadjuvant therapy can improve outcomes in these patients. Patients and methods: Patients with resectable EAC were enrolled and randomised into two single-arm, multicentre phase II trials. After induction cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF), all were assessed by day 15 positron emission tomography (PET). Patients with an EMR [maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) ≥35% reduction from baseline to day 15 PET] received a second CF cycle then oesophagectomy. Non-responders were randomised 1: 1 to two cycles of CF and docetaxel (DCF, n = 31) or DCF + 45 Gy radiotherapy (DCFRT, n = 35) then oesophagectomy. The primary end point was major histological response (<10% residual tumour) in the oesophagectomy specimen; secondary end points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and locoregional recurrence (LR). Results: Of 124 patients recruited, major histological response was achieved in 3/45 (7%) with EMR, 6/30 (20%) DCF, and 22/35 (63%) DCFRT patients. Grade 3/4 toxicities occurred in 12/45 (27%) EMR (CF), 13/31 (42%) DCF, and 25/35 (71%) DCFRT patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. LR by 3 years was seen in 5/45 (11%) EMR, 10/31 (32%) DCF, and 4/35 (11%) DCFRT patients. PFS [95% confidence interval (CI)] at 36 months was 47% (31% to 61%) for EMR, 29% (15% to 45%) for DCF, and 46% (29% to 61%) for DCFRT patients. OS (95% CI) at 60 months was 53% (37% to 67%) for EMR, 31% (16% to 48%) for DCF, and 46% (29% to 61%) for DCFRT patients. Conclusions: EMR is associated with favourable OS, PFS, and low LR. For non-responders, the addition of docetaxel augmented histological response rates, but OS, PFS, and LR remained inferior compared with responders. DCFRT improved histological response and PFS/LR outcomes, matching the EMR group. Early PET/CT has the potential to tailor therapy for patients not showing an early response to chemotherapy.   MP: Background: Resection remains the best treatment for carcinoma of the oesophagus in terms of local control, but local recurrence and distant metastasis remain an issue after surgery. We aimed to assess whether a short preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen improves outcomes for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer. Methods: 128 patients were randomly assigned to surgery alone and 128 patients to surgery after 80 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1, 800 mg/m2 fluorouracil on days 1-4, with concurrent radiotherapy of 35 Gy given in 15 fractions. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, tumour response, toxic effects, patterns of failure, and quality of life. Analysis was done by intention to treat. Findings: Neither progression-free survival nor overall survival differed between groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82 [95% CI 0·61-1·10] and 0·89 [0·67-1·19], respectively). The chemoradiotherapy-and-surgery group had more complete resections with clear margins than did the surgery-alone group (103 of 128 [80%] vs 76 of 128 [59%], p=0·0002), and had fewer positive lymph nodes (44 of 103 [43%] vs 69 of 103 [67%], p=0·003). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with squamous-cell tumours had better progression-free survival with chemoradiotherapy than did those with non-squamous tumours (HR 0·47 [0·25-0·86] vs 1·02 [0·72-1·44]). However, the trial was underpowered to determine the real magnitude of benefit in this subgroup. Interpretation: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil does not significantly improve progression-free or overall survival for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer compared with surgery alone. However, further assessment is warranted of the role of chemoradiotherapy in patients with squamous-cell tumours.  MP: Background Peri-operative chemotherapy and surgery is a standard of care for patients with resectable oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, improves the proportion of patients responding to treatment in advanced gastric cancer. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of adding bevacizumab to peri-operative chemotherapy in patients with resectable gastric, oesophagogastric junction, or lower oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Methods In this multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 2–3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with histologically proven, resectable oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma from 87 UK hospitals and cancer centres. We randomly assigned patients 1:1 to receive peri-operative epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, in addition to surgery. Patients in the control group (chemotherapy alone) received three pre-operative and three post-operative cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine chemotherapy: 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 and 1250 mg/m2 oral capecitabine on days 1–21. Patients in the investigational group received the same treatment as the control group plus 7·5 mg/kg intravenous bevacizumab on day 1 of every cycle of chemotherapy and for six further doses once every 21 days following chemotherapy, as maintenance treatment. Randomisation was done by means of a telephone call to the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, where staff used a computer programme that implemented a minimisation algorithm with a random element to establish the allocation for the patient at the point of randomisation. Patients were stratified by chemotherapy centre, site of tumour, and tumour stage. The primary outcome for the phase 3 stage of the trial was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause), analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Here, we report the primary analysis results of the trial; all patients have completed treatment and the required number of primary outcome events has been reached. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 46020948, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00450203. Findings Between Oct 31, 2007, and March 25, 2014, 1063 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy alone (n=533) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (n=530). At the time of analysis, 508 deaths were recorded (248 in the chemotherapy alone group and 260 in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group). 3-year overall survival was 50·3% (95% CI 45·5–54·9) in the chemotherapy alone group and 48·1% (43·2–52·7) in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·08, 95% CI 0·91–1·29; p=0·36). Apart from neutropenia no other toxic effects were reported at grade 3 or worse severity in more than 10% of patients in either group. Wound healing complications were more prevalent in the bevacizumab group, occurring in 53 (12%) patients in this group compared with 33 (7%) patients in the chemotherapy alone group. In patients who underwent oesophagogastrectomy, post-operative anastomotic leak rates were higher in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group (23 [10%] of 233 in the chemotherapy alone group vs 52 [24%] of 220 in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group); therefore, recruitment of patients with lower oesophageal or junctional tumours planned for an oesophagogastric resection was stopped towards the end of the trial. Serious adverse events for all patients included anastomotic leaks (30 events in chemotherapy alone group vs 69 in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group), and infections with normal neutrophil count (42 events vs 53). Interpretation The results of this trial do not provide any evidence for the use of bevacizumab in combination with peri-operative epiribicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine chemotherapy for patients with resectable gastric, oesophagogastric junction, or lower oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Bevacizumab might also be associated with impaired wound healing. Funding Cancer Research UK, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, and F Hoffmann-La Roche Limited.   MP: Background The role of postoperative radiotherapy in pathological T2–3N0M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with pathological T2–3N0M0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  Materials and Methods Patients aged 18–72 years with pathological stage T2–3N0M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after radical surgery and without neoadjuvant therapy were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to surgery alone or to receive postoperative radiotherapy of 50.4 Gy in supraclavicular field and 56 Gy in mediastinal field in 28 fractions over 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival. The secondary endpoints were local‐regional recurrence rate, overall survival, and radiation‐related toxicities.  Results From October 2012 to February 2018, 167 patients were enrolled in this study. We analyzed 157 patients whose follow‐up time was more than 1 year or who had died. The median follow‐up time was 45.6 months. The 3‐year disease‐free survival rates were 75.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.9–85.5) in the postoperative radiotherapy group and 58.7% (95% CI 48.2–71.5) in the surgery group (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.30–0.94, p = .030). Local‐regional recurrence rate decreased significantly in the radiotherapy group (10.0% vs. 32.5% in the surgery group, p = .001). The overall survival and distant metastasis rates were not significantly different between two groups. Grade 3 toxicity rate related to radiotherapy was 12.5%.  Conclusion Postoperative radiotherapy significantly increased disease‐free survival and decreased local regional recurrence rate in patients with pathological T2–3N0M0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with acceptable toxicities in this interim analysis. Further enrollment and follow‐up are warranted to validate these findings in this ongoing trial.  MP: Background: Docetaxel-based chemotherapy is effective in metastatic gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This study reports on the safety and efficacy of the docetaxel-based triplet FLOT (fluorouracil plus leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel)as a perioperative therapy for patients with locally advanced, resectable tumours. Methods: In this controlled, open-label, phase 2/3 trial, we randomly assigned 716 patients with histologically-confirmed advanced clinical stage cT2 or higher or nodal positive stage (cN+), or both, resectable tumours, with no evidence of distant metastases, via central interactive web-based-response system, to receive either three pre-operative and three postoperative 3-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 plus either 200 mg/m2 fluorouracil as continuous intravenous infusion or 1250 mg/m2 capecitabine orally on days 1 to 21 (ECF/ECX; control group)or four preoperative and four postoperative 2-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 docetaxel, 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 leucovorin and 2600 mg/m2 fluorouracil as 24-h infusion on day 1 (FLOT; experimental group). The primary outcome of the trial was overall survival (superiority)analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01216644. Findings: Between Aug 8, 2010, and Feb 10, 2015, 716 patients were randomly assigned to treatment in 38 German hospitals or with practice-based oncologists. 360 patients were assigned to ECF/ECX and 356 patients to FLOT. Overall survival was increased in the FLOT group compared with the ECF/ECX group (hazard ratio [HR]0·77; 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.63 to 0·94]; median overall survival, 50 months [38·33 to not reached]vs 35 months [27·35 to 46·26]). The number of patients with related serious adverse events (including those occurring during hospital stay for surgery)was similar in the two groups (96 [27%]in the ECF/ECX group vs 97 [27%]in the FLOT group), as was the number of toxic deaths (two [<1%]in both groups). Hospitalisation for toxicity occurred in 94 patients (26%)in the ECF/ECX group and 89 patients (25%)in the FLOT group. Interpretation: In locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, perioperative FLOT improved overall survival compared with perioperative ECF/ECX.   MP: Purpose: We performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcome in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing radical surgery. Patients and Methods: Patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy between July 1992 and January 1997 at 17 institutions were randomly assigned to receive surgery alone or surgery plus chemotherapy including two courses of cisplatin (80 mg/m2 of body-surface area × 1 day) and fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 × 5 days) within 2 months after, surgery. Adaptive stratification factors were institution and lymph node status (pNO versus pN1). The primary end point was disease-free survival. Results: Of the 242 patients, 122 were assigned to surgery alone, and 120 to surgery plus chemotherapy. In the surgery plus chemotherapy group, 91 patients (75%) received both full courses of chemotherapy; grade 3 or 4 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities were limited. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 45% with surgery alone, and 55% with surgery plus chemotherapy (one-sided log-rank, P = .037). The 5-year overall survival rate was 52% and 61%, respectively (P = .13). Risk reduction by postoperative chemotherapy was remarkable in the subgroup with lymph node metastasis. Conclusion: Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil is better able to prevent relapse in patients with esophageal cancer than surgery alone.  MP: Background Patients with esophageal carcinoma receiving postoperative chemotherapy showed superior disease-free survival than those receiving surgery alone in a Japan Clinical Oncology Group trial (JCOG9204). The purpose of this study was to evaluate optimal perioperative timing—that is, before or after surgery—for providing chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  Methods Eligible patients with clinical stage II or III, excluding T4, squamous cell carcinoma were randomized to undergo surgery followed (group 1) or preceded (group 2) by chemotherapy consisting of two courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. The primary end point was progression-free survival.  Results We randomized 330 patients, with 166 assigned to group 1 and 164 to group 2, between May 2000 and May 2006. The planned interim analysis was conducted after completion of patient accrual. Progression-free survival did not reach the stopping boundary, but overall survival in group 2 was superior to that of group 1 (P = 0.01). Therefore, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early publication. Updated analyses showed the 5-year overall survival to be 43% in group 1 and 55% in group 2 (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.99, P = 0.04), where the median follow-up of censored patients was 61.6 months. Concerning operative morbidity, renal dysfunction after surgery in group 2 was slightly higher than in group 1.  Conclusions Preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil can be regarded as standard treatment for patients with stage II/III squamous cell carcinoma.  MP: Purpose Toxicity, pathologic complete response, and long-term outcomes are reported for the neoadjuvant therapies assessed in a randomized phase 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and American College of Radiology Imaging Network trial for operable esophageal adenocarcinoma, staged as II-IVa by endoscopy/ultrasonography (EUS). Methods and Materials A total of 86 eligible patients began treatment. For arm A, preoperative chemotherapy was cisplatin, 30 mg/m2, and irinotecan, 50 mg/m2, on day 1, 8, 22, 29 during 45 Gy radiation therapy (RT), 1.8 Gy per day over 5 weeks. Adjuvant therapy was cisplatin, 30 mg/m2, and irinotecan, 65 mg/m2 day 1, 8 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Arm B therapy was cisplatin, 30 mg/m2, and paclitaxel, 50 mg/m2, day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 with RT, followed by adjuvant cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, and paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2, day 1 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Stratification included EUS stage and performance status. Results In arm A, median overall survival was 35 months, and 5-, 6-, and 7-year survival rates were 46%, 39%, and 35%, respectively, whereas for arm B, they were 21 months and 27%, 27%, and 23%, respectively. Median progression- or recurrence-free survival (PFS) was 39.8 months with a 3-year PFS of 50% for arm A and 12.4 months (P=.046) with 3-year PFS of 28% for arm B. Eighty percent of the observed incidents of progression occurred within 19 months. Survival did not differ significantly by EUS and performance status strata. Conclusions Long-term survival was similar for both arms and did not appear superior to results achieved with other standard regimens.  MP: Background. Despite well-established surgical approaches, the prognosis for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus remains dismal. To assess the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT), a randomized trial with and without sequential preoperative CRT was undertaken; CRT combined 20 Gy and two courses of 5-FU and cisplatin.  Methods. Patients were included on the basis of the following criteria: squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, younger than 70 years of age, World Health Organization status below 2, estimated survival time greater than 3 months, and no previous treatment for the cancer. Patients were not included if they had experienced a loss in body weight greater than 15% or had tracheoesophageal fistula, metastases, or uncontrollable infection.  Results. Eighty-six patients thus fulfilled the criteria for inclusion (41 CRT, 45 non-CRT). The groups were well-matched for age, sex, tumor location, size, and grade. Operative mortality was 8.5% and 7%, respectively, for each group with a 27-day hospital stay for both groups. Long-term survival was not significantly different, with 47% of both groups alive at 1 year.  Conclusions. The authors concluded that this neoadjuvant treatment did not change operative mortality or survival time for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.  MP: Background: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing surgery alone (S) with concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (CRT-S) for resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) based on our previous report. Patients and methods: One hundred and one patients with stage II/III esophageal SCC were randomized to receive either S (50 patients) or CRT-S (51 patients). The chemoradiotherapy (CRT) consisted of cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on day 1,5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1000 mg/m2 i.v. on days 2-5, cisplatin 60 mg/m2 i.v. on day 22 combined with radiation therapy (45.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. on days 1-28). Surgery was performed 3-4 weeks after radiotherapy was completed. For patients with disease that was stable or responsive to CRT, three additional cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 60 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1,5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 2-5 every 4 weeks) were given after surgical resection. Results: The median age was 62 years. The toxicity of CRT was acceptable and did not affect the post-operative morbidity and the duration of hospital stay. Clinical response was 86% including 21% of complete response (CR) rate. Pathological CR was achieved in 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27-59] of the patients who underwent surgery after CRT. At a median follow-up of 25 months, median overall survival (OS) was 27.3 months in S and 28.2 months in CRT-S (P = 0.69). Event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years was 51% in S and 49% in CRT-S (P = 0.93). This trial, which was statistically powered to detect a relatively large difference in 2-year survival rate from 30% to 50% with 80% power, was discontinued at interim analysis because of the unexpectedly high drop-out rate for esophagectomy (31%) and resultant excessive locoregional failure rate in CRT-S arm (22% versus 12%, P = 0.31), though it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Although preoperative CRT induced high clinical and pathological response, there was no statistically significant benefit in OS and EFS.  MP: Purpose The optimal perioperative treatment for resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil (LV5FU2) and LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) combination chemotherapies administered adjuvantly for curatively-resected, node-positive ESCC. Materials and Methods Patients with pathologically node-positive esophageal cancer after curative R0 resection were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive LV5FU2 or FOLFOX biweekly for up to eight cycles. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Results Between 2011 and 2015, 62 patients were randomized into the two treatment groups (32 in the LV5FU2 arm and 30 in the FOLFOX arm). The median age was 60 years and both groups had similar pathologic characteristics in tumor, nodal status, and location. Treatment completion rates were similarly high in both groups. The DFS rate at 12 months was 67% in the LV5FU2 group and 63% in the FOLFOX group with a hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 2.62). After a median follow-up period of 27 months, the median DFS was 29.6 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 54.2) in the LV5FU2 arm and 16.8 months (95% CI, 7.5 to 26.1) in the FOLFOX arm (p=0.428), respectively, while the median overall survival was not reached in either arm. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more frequent in patients in the FOLFOX arm than the LV5FU2 arm (20.0% vs. 3.1%). Conclusion The addition of oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) did not lead to better efficacy compared to LV5FU2 chemotherapy in an adjuvant setting in node-positive ESCC patients.  MP: AIM: To investigate the role of perioperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the treatment of locally advanced thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).  METHODS: Using preoperative computed tomography (CT)-based staging criteria, 238 patients with ESCC (stage II-III) were enrolled in this prospective study between January 1997 and June 2004. With informed consent, patients were randomized into 3 groups: preoperative CRT (80 cases), postoperative CRT (78 cases) and surgery alone (S) (80 cases). The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year survival were followed up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was chosen as the primary endpoint by treatment arm measured from study entry until documented progression of disease or death from any cause. The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS) determined as the time (in months) between the date of therapy and the date of death. Other objectives were surgical and adjuvant therapy complications.  RESULTS: With median follow-up of 45 mo for all the enrolled patients, significant differences in the 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-year OS (91.3%, 63.5%, 43.5%, 24.5% vs 91%, 62.8%, 42.3%, 24.4% vs 87.5%, 51.3%, 33.8%, 12.5%, P = 0.0176) and PFS (89.3%, 61.3%, 37.5%, 18.1% vs 89.1%, 61.1%, 37.2%, 17.8% vs 84.5%, 49.3%, 25.9%, 6.2%, P = 0.0151) were detected among the 3 arms. There were no significant differences in OS and PFS between the preoperative CRT and postoperative CRT arm (P > 0.05). For the patients who had radical resection, significant differences in median PFS (48 mo vs 61 mo vs 39.5 mo, P = 0.0331) and median OS (56.5 mo vs 72 mo vs 41.5 mo, P = 0.0153) were detected among the 3 arms, but there were no significant differences in OS and PFS between the preoperative CRT and postoperative CRT arm (P > 0.05). The local recurrence rates in the preoperative CRT, postoperative CRT group and S group were 11.3%, 14.1% and 35%, respectively (P < 0.05). No significant differences were detected among the 3 groups when comparing complications but tended to be in favor of the postoperative CRT and S groups (P > 0.05). Toxicities of CRT in the preoperative or postoperative CRT arms were mostly moderate, and could be quickly alleviated by adequate therapy.  CONCLUSION: Rational application of preoperative or postoperative CRT can provide a benefit in PFS and OS in patients with locally advanced ESCC.

"Background and aims Opioid use in heart failure (HF) management is controversial, and whether rapid symptomatic relief outweighs the risks of opioid use in HF remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the clinical outcomes of opioid administration in patients with acute or chronic HF.  Methods A systematic search for eligible studies was conducted in databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO) and registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO Clinical Trial Registry) until June 8, 2022. Odds ratios (ORs) or adjusted OR (aORs) and mean difference (MD) or standardized MD were quantified for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. Meta-regression was performed using the restricted maximum likelihood method.  Results A total of 20 studies (154,736 participants) were included. In acute HF, opioid use presented a high risk for in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–5.38; I2 = 97%), invasive (OR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.17–6.61; I2 = 93%) and noninvasive (OR = 2.97; 95%CI: 1.06–8.28; I2 = 95%) ventilations, intensive care unit admission (OR = 3.62; 95%CI: 3.11–4.21; I2 = 6%), and inotrope use (OR = 2.54; 95%CI: 1.94–3.32; I2 = 63%). In chronic HF New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II/III, opioid use improved ventilatory efficiency (MD = −3.16; 95%CI: (−4.78)–(−1.54); I2 = 0%), and exercise test duration (MD = 69.24; 95%CI: 10.11–128.37; I2 = 89%).  Conclusions Opioids are not recommended for acute HF management; however, they showed an advantage in exercise testing by improving ventilatory efficiency, chemosensitivity, and exercise test duration in stable patients with chronic HF NYHA Class II/III. Nonetheless, larger randomized controlled trials and individual patient-level data meta-analyses are warranted.","MP: Background: Nitrates are superior to furosemide in the management of acute pulmonary edema associated with myocardial infarction; however, their role in the absence of infarction is unclear. Methods and Results: A randomized comparison was undertaken of the relative effectiveness of primary therapy with either intravenous morphine/furosemide (men/women; n = 32) or nitroglycerin/N-acetylcysteine (NTG/NAC; n = 37) in consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema. The primary end point was change in PaO2/FIO2 over the first 60 minutes of therapy. Secondary end points were needed for mechanical respiratory assistance (ie, continuous positive airway pressure via mask or intubation and ventilation) and changes in other gas exchange parameters. Both treatment groups showed improvement in oxygenation after 60 minutes of therapy; however, this reached statistical significance only with NTG/NAC therapy. There was no significant difference between groups in the assessed parameters (95% Cl for differences in PaO2/FIO2: furosemide/morphine -12 to 23 and NTG/NAC 4 to 44), a finding also confirmed in 32 patients presenting with respiratory failure. Only 11% of the study group required mechanical ventilatory assistance (continuous positive airway pressure in 4 patients and intubation and ventilation in 3 patients). Conclusions: NTG/NAC therapy is as effective as furosemide/morphine in the initial management of acute pulmonary edema, regardless of the presence or absence of respiratory failure. The necessity for mechanical ventilatory assistance is infrequent in these patients, regardless of the initial medical treatment regimen.  MP: Background: Morphine has been a pivotal therapy in acute heart failure (AHF) for more than a century. The evidence for morphine therapy in AHF remains controversial. This study sought to assess the therapeutic effect of morphine on patients with AHF. Methods: The study used a cohort of 13,788 patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of AHF. Propensity-score-matching was generated using 26 clinical variables. Primary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints included non-invasive ventilation, need for inotropes and acute kidney injury (AKI). Results: 761 (5.5%) patients were treated with morphine in the first day following hospital admission. Propensity score matching yielded 672 patient pairs. The incidence of invasive ventilation was higher in the morphine-treated patients (7.4%) than in matched patients in the no-morphine cohort (3.6%), OR 2.13 (95% CI 1.32–3.57, P = 0.007). In-hospital mortality was also higher in the morphine group (17.4%) than in the matched no-morphine group (13.4%), OR 1.43 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.98, P = 0.024). For both the endpoint of invasive ventilation (Ptrend = 0.005) and mortality (Ptrend = 0.004), there was a significant linear dose-response relationship for the adverse effect of morphine. Morphine was associated with a significant increase in all secondary outcomes: Non-invasive ventilation (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.95–3.96); Inotrope use (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.10–5.82) and AKI (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.39–2.36). A landmark analysis demonstrated no difference in post-discharge survival between cohorts. Conclusions: Morphine administration is associated with significant dose-dependent risk for in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation.  MP: Objective. To understand the relationship between opioid use in patients with congestive heart failure and outcomes, we compared length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rates, and 30- and 90-day mortality in patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) who were taking opioids. Design. Retrospective study design. Setting. Patients were seen at a 320-bed academic hospital. Subjects. All patients not awaiting transplant who were discharged with a primary diagnosis of heart failure from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2014. Methods. Records were reviewed for demographic data, comorbidities, and opioid status at admission or discharge. The association of opioid use (at admission and discharge) with LOS, 30-day readmission, and 30- and 90-day mortality was examined. Results. Six hundred eighty-two patients with a principle diagnosis of heart failure were admitted during the study period, with 168 (24.6%) taking opioids at admission. Opioid use at admission was not significantly associated with 30-day readmission (odds ratio [OR]=1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.80-1.93), 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.91, 95% CI=0.47-1.78), 90-day mortality (HR=0.95, 95% CI=0.58-1.54), or LOS (parameter estimate=-0.21, 95% CI=20.91 to 0.48). One hundred ninety-three patients (28.3%) were prescribed opioids at discharge. No significant differences were observed between those who were and were not taking opioids at discharge for 30-day readmission (OR=1.10, 95% CI=0.72-1.69) or for 30- or 90-day mortality (HR=0.51, 95% CI=0.24-1.06, and HR=0.67, 95% CI=0.41-1.10, respectively). LOS was slightly shorter for patients not using opioids at discharge than for those who were (mean=3.8 vs 4.6 days, respectively). Conclusions. Opioid use at admission or discharge in patients with CHF did not appear to affect outcomes.  MP: Background: Drug treatments for acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (ACPO) have not been rigorously evaluated and recent observational data suggests some agents are related to poorer outcome. Aim: We aimed to examine the effect of treatment with diuretics, nitrates and opiates on 7-day mortality, acidosis and respiratory distress in UK Emergency Department (ED) patients with severe acidotic pulmonary oedema. Design: Analysis of data from the 3CPO trial; a multicentre randomized controlled trial. Methods: Data were analysed from patients recruited with severe acidotic pulmonary oedema to the 3CPO trial in 26 UK EDs between 2003 and 2007. The effects of these treatments on 7-day mortality, improvement in acidosis (pH change between baseline and 1 h) and improvement in respiratory distress (patient measured breathlessness using a Visual Analogue Score between baseline and 1 h) were tested using univariate logistic regression analysis, and a regression model used to adjust for confounding baseline differences. Results: Nitrates were given to 947/1048 (90.4%) patients, diuretics to 934/1049 (89.0%) patients and opiates to 541/1052 patients (51.4%). Adjusted analysis showed that opiate treatment was associated with less improvement in acidosis [difference in improvement in pH -0.022, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.014 to -0.030, P<0.001], but no difference in mortality or improvement in respiratory distress. We found no evidence that nitrate or diuretic use were associated with any difference in mortality, improvement in acidosis or respiratory distress. Conclusions: Opiate use is associated with less improvement in acidosis during initial treatment and may attenuate effective treatment of severe acidotic ACPO.   MP: Background: Current guidelines regarding the use of intravenous morphine (IM) in the management of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are discordant; whereas the American guidelines reserve IM for terminal patients, the European guidelines recommend its use in the early stage of treatment. Our aim was to determine the impact of IM on outcomes of ADHF patients. Methods: Stepwise logistic regression and propensity score analysis of ADHF patients with and without use of IM was performed in a national heart failure survey. Results: Of the 4102 enrolled patients, we identified 2336 ADHF patients, of whom 218 (9.3%) received IM. IM patients were more likely to have acute coronary syndromes, acute rather than exacerbation of chronic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. They had higher heart rate, were less likely to receive diuretics and more likely to receive aspirin and statins. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 11.5% versus 5.0% for patients who did or did not receive IM, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital death was: 2.0 (1.1-3.5, P = 0.02). Using propensity analysis, we identified 218 matched pairs of patients who did or did not receive IM. In multivariable analysis accounting for the propensity score (c-statistic 0.82), IM was not associated with increased in-hospital death (OR: 1.2 (0.6-2.4), P = 0.55). Conclusion: IM was used sparingly in our ADHF cohort, and was independently associated with increased in-hospital death in multivariable analysis, but not in propensity score analysis. Thus, IM may be used in ADHF, but with caution. Further randomized trials are warranted.  MP: Background: In the field of palliative care, morphine is known to be effective for alleviating dyspnea in cancer patients. However, little is known regarding the safety and efficacy of morphine therapy for refractory dyspnea as palliative care in advanced heart failure (HF) patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive advanced HF patients who were referred to the Palliative Care Team at our institution and administered morphine for refractory dyspnea during hospitalization between September 2013 and December 2018. We investigated the details of morphine usage, vital signs, an 11-point quantitative symptom scale, and adverse events at baseline, 24 h, and 72 h after the start of treatment. Results: Morphine was administered for refractory dyspnea in 43 advanced HF patients [mean age: 73.5 years, male: 28 (65%), New York Heart Association functional class IV: 43 (100%), median left ventricular ejection fraction: 25%, median B-type natriuretic peptide level: 927 pg/ml, concurrent intravenous inotrope: 33 (77%)]. Median initial dose of morphine was 5 mg/day in both oral and intravenous administration and median duration of administration was 5 days. Significant decreases in an 11-point quantitative symptom scale [7 (5, 9) vs. 2 (1, 6); p < 0.01, (data available in 8 patients)] and respiratory rate (22.2 ± 6.1 vs. 19.7 ± 5.2 breaths per minute; p < 0.01) were observed 24 h after the start of morphine administration. Meanwhile, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate were not significantly altered after treatment (NS). Common adverse events were delirium (18%) and constipation (8%); however, no lethal adverse event definitely related to morphine therapy occurred during treatment. Conclusions: This single-center retrospective study revealed the clinical practice of morphine therapy and suggested that morphine therapy might be feasible for refractory dyspnea as palliative care in advanced HF patients.   MP: The objective was to determine the relationship between short-term mortality and intravenous morphine use in ED patients who received a diagnosis of acute heart failure (AHF).  Methods Consecutive patients with AHF presenting to 34 Spanish EDs from 2011 to 2014 were eligible for inclusion. The subjects were divided into those with (M) or without IV morphine treatment (WOM) groups during ED stay. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were mortality at different intermediate time points, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay. We generated a propensity score to match the M and WOM groups that were 1:1 according to 46 different epidemiological, baseline, clinical, and therapeutic factors. We investigated independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients receiving morphine.  Results We included 6,516 patients (mean age, 81 [SD, 10] years; 56% women): 416 (6.4%) in the M and 6,100 (93.6%) in the WOM group. Overall, 635 (9.7%; M, 26.7%; WOM, 8.6%) died by day 30. After propensity score matching, 275 paired patients constituted each group. Patients receiving morphine had a higher 30-day mortality (55 [20.0%] vs 35 [12.7%] deaths; hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.09-2.54; P = .017). In patients receiving morphine, death was directly related to glycemia (P = .013) and inversely related to the baseline Barthel index and systolic BP (P = .021) at ED arrival (P = .021). Mortality was increased at every intermediate time point, although the greatest risk was at the shortest time (at 3 days: 22 [8.0%] vs 7 [2.5%] deaths; OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.40-7.93; P = .014). In-hospital mortality did not increase (39 [14.2%] vs 26 [9.1%] deaths; OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.97-2.82; P = .083) and LOS did not differ between groups (median [interquartile range] in M, 8 [7]; WOM, 8 [6]; P = .79).  Conclusions This propensity score-matched analysis suggests that the use of IV morphine in AHF could be associated with increased 30-day mortality.  MP: Objective Little is known about treatments provided by advanced life support (ALS) ambulance teams to patients with acute heart failure (AHF) during the prehospital phase, and their influence on short-term outcome. We evaluated the effect of prehospital care in consecutive patients diagnosed with AHF in Spanish emergency departments (EDs).  Methods We selected patients from the EAHFE registry arriving at the ED by ALS ambulances with available follow-up data. We recorded specific prehospital ALS treatments (supplemental oxygen, diuretics, nitroglycerin, non-invasive ventilation) and patients were grouped according to whether they received low- (LIPHT; 0/1 treatments) or high-intensity prehospital therapy (HIPHT; > 1 treatment) for AHF. We also recorded 46 covariates. The primary endpoint was all-cause 7-day mortality, and secondary endpoints were prolonged hospitalisation (> 10 days) and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to compare the groups.  Results We included 1493 patients [mean age 80.7 (10) years; women 54.8%]. Prehospital treatment included supplemental oxygen in 71.2%, diuretics in 27.9%, nitroglycerin in 13.5%, and non-invasive ventilation in 5.3%. The LIPHT group included 1041 patients (70.0%) with an unadjusted OR for 7-day mortality of 1.770 (95% CI 1.115–2.811; p = 0.016), and 1.939 (95% CI 1.114–3.287, p = 0.014) after adjustment for 16 discordant covariables. The adjusted ORs for all secondary endpoints were always > 1 in the LIPHT group, but none reached statistical significance.  Conclusions Patients finally diagnosed with AHF at then ED that have received LIPHT by the ALS ambulance teams have a poorer short-term outcome, especially during the first 7 days.  MP: Rationale: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in adults hospitalized with acute heart failure. Data are limited on the implications of inadvertent opiate use in this population. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and impact of in-hospital opiate use in adults hospitalized for acute heart failure. Methods: From a prospective sleep registry, we selected a sequential group of adult participants who were admitted to the hospital for acute heart failure and received a portable sleep study (PSS) after screening for SDB using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. A retrospective review of charts was performed to assess use of opiates, need for escalation of care (defined as transfer to the intensive care unit [ICU]), 30-day readmission, and length of stay. A logistic regression model was used to calculate propensity scores for each participant with a screening apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) greater than or equal to 10/h. Study endpoints, including escalation of care to the ICU and 30-day hospital readmission, were compared using a x2 test with stabilized inverse probability-weighted propensity scores to control for potential confounding variables. Results: A total of 301 consecutive adults admitted with acute heart failure between November 2016 and October 2017 underwent PSS after SDB screening. Overall, 125 of 301 (41.5%) received opiates in the hospital, and 149 (49.5%) patients had an AHI greater than or equal to 10/h by PSS (high risk of SDB). In this high-risk group, 47 of 149 (32%) received opiates. Among those with an AHI greater than or equal to 10/h, escalation of care occurred in 12 of 47 (26%) of those who received opiates versus 4 of 102 (4%) of those who did not (P<0.001; weighted estimate of treatment difference, 23.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9 to 37.2). Similarly, readmission within 30 days occurred in 7 of 47 (15%) of those who received opiates versus 9 of 102 (9%) of those who did not (P = 0.14; weighted estimate of treatment difference, 8.3%; 95% CI, 24.0 to 20.6). Mean length of stay (days) did not differ between groups (P = 0.61; weighted estimate of treatment difference, 20.3 d; 95% CI, 21.4 to 0.8). Conclusions: In adults admitted with acute heart failure and found to be at high risk of SDB, opiate use in the hospital was highly prevalent and was associated with a greater likelihood of escalation of care.  MP: Objective: Morphine is a long-standing therapy in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), despite few supporting data. A study was undertaken to compare the outcomes of patients who did and did not receive morphine for ADHF. Methods: The study was a retrospective analysis of the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) which enrols hospitalised patients with treatment for, or a primary discharge diagnosis of, ADHF. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on whether or not they received intravenous morphine. ANOVA, Wilcoxon and χ2 tests were used in univariate analysis, followed by multivariate analysis controlling for parameters previously associated with mortality. Analyses were repeated for ejection fraction subgroups and in patients not on mechanical ventilation. Results: There were 147 362 hospitalisations in ADHERE at December 2004, 20 782 of whom (14.1%) received morphine and 126 580 (85.9%) did not. There were no clinically relevant differences between the groups in the initial age, heart rate, blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, haemoglobin. ejection fraction or atrial fibrillation. A higher prevalence of rest dyspnoea, congestion on chest radiography, rales and raised troponin occurred in the morphine group. Patients on morphine received more inotropes and vasodilators, were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (15.4% vs 2.8%), had a longer median hospitalisation (5.6 vs 4.2 days), more ICU admissions (38.7% vs 14.4%), and had greater mortality (13.0% vs 2.4%) (all p<0.001). Even after risk adjustment and exclusion of ventilated patients, morphine was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 4.84 (95% Cl 4.52 to 5.18), p<0.001). Conclusions: Morphine is associated with increased adverse events in ADHF which includes a greater frequency of mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalisation, more ICU admissions and higher mortality.  MP: Acute pulmonary edema (APE) is a common Emergency Department (ED) presentation requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). This study was undertaken to examine the effect of ED management on the need for ICU admission in patients with APE. ED records of APE patients were abstracted for patient age, prehospital and ED pharmacological treatment, diagnoses, airway interventions, and ICU length of stay (LOS). Statistical analysis was through multiple regression, logistic regression, chi-square, and ANOVA. One hundred eighty-one patients composed the study group. Pharmacological treatment included nitroglycerin (NTG), 147 patients (81%); morphine sulfate (MS), 88 (49%); loop diuretics (LD), 133 (73%); and captopril sublingual (CSL), 47 (26%). Use of CSL and MS were associated with opposing needs for ICU admission. MS use was associated with increased ICU admissions (odds ratio, 3.08; P = .002), whereas CSL use was associated with decreased ICU admissions (odds ratio, 0.29; P = .002). Morphine sulfate use also demonstrated an increased need for endotracheal intubation (ETI) (odds ratio, 5.04; P = .001), whereas CSL demonstrated a decreased need for ETI (odds ratio, 0.16; P = .008). Ninety-three patients required some form of respiratory support. Forty received noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NPSV) from a bilevel positive airway pressure system (BiPAP), and 60 received endotracheal intubation. Some patients received more than 1 form of respiratory support; all other patients received supplemental oxygen only. The ICU-LOS associated with different airway interventions were supplemental oxygen, 0.72 days; BiPAP, 1.48 days; and ETI, 3.70 days (P < .001). Specific ED pharmacological interventions are associated with a decreased need for ICU admission and endotracheal intubation in acute pulmonary edema patients, whereas use of noninvasive pressure support ventilation correlates with a reduction in the ICU length of stay for patients who do require critical care admission.  MP: Background:The use of opioids is associated with poor outcomes. Less is known about this association in patients with heart failure (HF) and whether it varies by the receipt of hospice care.Methods:Of the 7467 patients hospitalized for HF without previous opioid use, 124 received discharge opioids. We matched 123 of these patients with 123 not receiving opioids based on their propensity scores for opioid use, thus assembling a matched cohort of 246 patients balanced on 30 baseline characteristics (mean age, 76 years, 60% women, and 11% African American). We repeated the process in hospice (n = 155; 20 received opioids) and nonhospice (n = 7298; 104 received opioids) subgroups, thus assembling 2 matched cohorts of 22 and 208 patients, respectively. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with opioid use were estimated from matched cohorts.Results:During 8.6 (median, 1.4) years of follow-up, all-cause mortality occurred in 80% and 68% of matched patients in the opioid and nonopioid groups, respectively (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.11-1.99; P = 0.008). There was evidence of heterogeneity in this association between hospice and nonhospice patients (P for interaction, 0.027). Among matched hospice and nonhospice patients, HRs (95% CIs) for mortality were 6.37 (2.06-19.69; P = 0.001) and 1.42 (1.03-1.96; P = 0.035), respectively. HRs (95% CIs) for 30-day and 1-year mortality were 1.98 (1.06-3.70; P = 0.033) and 1.72 (1.18-2.49; P = 0.004), respectively. HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause, HF, and non-HF readmissions were 1.31 (0.97-1.76; P = 0.079), 1.03 (0.71-1.49; P = 0.866), and 1.75 (1.05-2.91; P = 0.031), respectively. Readmission associations were similar among matched nonhospice patients. There was no readmission among matched hospice patients receiving opioids.Conclusions:In older patients with HF, opioid use is associated with a higher risk of mortality, which is greater in the hospice subgroup, and a higher risk of non-HF readmission in the nonhospice subgroup.  MP: Background Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause for 30-day all-cause readmission. Opioids are commonly used by hospice to alleviate HF symptoms. However, its associations with all-cause readmission in HF remain unclear.  Methods Of the 7642 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for HF and discharged alive from 106 U.S. hospitals (1998-2001) with data on opioid use, 299 received these drugs both pre-admission and at discharge and 7343 received at neither times. Using propensity scores for opioid use, we assembled a matched cohort of 297 pairs of patients balanced on 34 baseline characteristics including discharge hospice referral (6% each; p=0.731).  Results 30-day all-cause readmissions occurred in 27% and 22% of matched patients receiving and not receiving opioids, respectively. (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.92-1.77; p=0.148). 30-day all-cause mortality occurred in 10% and 7% of matched patients receiving and not receiving opioids, respectively. (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.86-2.68; p=0.146). At 12 months post-discharge, opioid use was associated with higher all-cause readmission (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54; p=0.022) and higher mortality (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; p=0.031). Opioid use had no association with HF readmission.  Conclusions Among hospitalized patients with HF, opioid therapy had no association with 30-day all-cause or HF readmission or mortality but was associated with significantly higher long-term all-cause readmissions and mortality.  MP: Objectives. We sought to test the hypothesis that suppression of chemosensitivity (respiratory response to arterial blood gases) with dihydrocodeine may improve dyspnea and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. Background. Exertional dyspnea is a common limiting symptom in patients with chronic heart failure. The mechanisms underlying this symptom are not fully understood but may be related to increased ventilation caused, in part, by the augmentation of chemosensitivity. Suppression of chemosensitivity with mild opiates may thus improve this symptom as well as exercise tolerance. Methods. Twelve men with chronic heart failure (mean [±SE] age 65.5 ± 1.5 years, range 58 to 75; left ventricular ejection fraction 21.3 ± 3.0%, range 8 to 39) received placebo or dihydrocodeine (1 mg/kg body weight) on two separate days in a randomized, double-blind design. One hour later, hypoxic and hypercapnic chemosensitivities were assessed using the transient inhalations of pure nitrogen and the rebreathing of 7% carbon dioxide in 93% oxygen, followed by treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue during the exercise test were assessed using a modified Borg scale from 0 to 10. Results: There was a significant fall in hypoxic and hypercapnic chemosensitivities with dihydrocodeine administration compared with placebo (0.447 ± 0.096 vs. 0.746 ± 0.104 liter/min per percent arterial oxygen saturation, p = 0.005; 2.480 ± 0.234 vs. 2.966 ± 0.283 liter/min per mm Hg, p = 0.01, respectively). Exercise duration was prolonged from 455 ± 27 s on placebo to 512 ± 27 s (p = 0.001) with dihydrocodeine, and peak oxygen consumption increased from 18.0 ± 0.6 to 19.7 ± 0.6 ml/kg per min (p = 0.002). The ventilatory response to exercise, characterized by the regression slope relating minute ventilation to carbon dioxide output, decreased from 34.19 ± 2.35 to 30.85 ± 1.91 (p = 0.01). With dihydrocodeine administration, the change in the modified Borg score for dyspnea was -0.80 (p = 0.003) at 6 min and -0.33 (p = 0.52) at peak exercise, whereas that for fatigue did not change significantly. Arterial oxygen saturation was maintained during exercise despite dihydrocodeine administration (99.3% at rest vs. 98.9% at peak exercise, p = 0.21). Conclusions. Augmented chemosensitivity is important in the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure. Its suppression with dihydrocodeine was associated with a reduction of exercise ventilation, an improvement in exercise tolerance and a decrease in breathlessness. Pharmacologic modulation of chemosensitivity may benefit patients with chronic heart failure and merits further investigation.  MP: Background Cardiomyocytes produce opioid peptides and receptors. β-Endorphin is increased in the plasma of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). We evaluated whether an intravenous infusion of β-endorphin exerted any effect on cardiovascular function and on the neurohormonal milieu in patients with mild to moderate CHF. Methods According to a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 10 patients (5 men, age 46.9 ± 8.2 years [mean ± SD]) with CHF and New York Heart Association functional class II to III received, in random order, 1-hour intravenous infusion of β-endorphin (500 μg/h) and, on a separate occasion, received placebo and underwent echocardiographic and laboratory measurements at baseline and during infusions. Results β-Endorphin significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P = .0001) and stroke volume (P = .0001), and reduced systemic vascular resistance (P = .031) in patients with CHF. These changes were paralleled by a significant increase in plasma levels of glucagon (P = .0001), GH (P = .0001), and IGF-1 (P = .0001), and a significant decrease in plasma levels of endothelin (P = .0001) and catecholamines (P = .01). No hemodynamic and neurohormonal changes were observed during the placebo study in any patient. Conclusions We conclude that a short-term, high dose infusion of β-endorphin improves LVEF, reduces systemic vascular resistance, blunts the neurohormonal activation, and stimulates the GH/IGF-1 axis in patients with mild to moderate CHF.

"Objective To conduct a network meta-analysis comparing all treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) pain in the Cochrane Library.  Design The Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about treatments for hip and knee OA. We constructed 17 broad categories, comprising drug treatments, exercise, surgery, herbs, orthotics, passive treatments, regenerative medicine, diet/weight loss, combined treatments, and controls. In addition to a full network analysis, we compared the direct/indirect effects, and studies with shorter-/longer follow-up. CINeMA software was used for assessing confidence in network meta-analysis estimates.  Results We included 35 systematic reviews including 445 RCTs. There were 153 treatments for OA. In total, 491 comparisons were related to knee OA, less on hip OA, and only nine on hand OA. Six treatment categories showed clinically significant effects favoring treatment over control on pain. “Diet/weight loss” and “Surgery” had effect sizes close to zero. The network as a whole was not coherent. Of 136 treatment comparisons, none were rated as high confidence, six as moderate, 13 as low, and 117 as very low.  Conclusions Direct comparison of different available treatment options for OA is desirable, however not currently feasible in practice, due to heterogeneous study populations and lack of clear descriptions of control interventions. We found that many treatments were effective, but since the network as a whole was not coherent and lacked high confidence in the treatment comparisons, we could not produce a ranking of effects.","MP: Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the management of spinal pain and osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2014. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of paracetamol with placebo for spinal pain (neck or low back pain) and osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data on pain, disability, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects, patient adherence, and use of rescue medication. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). We calculated weighted mean differences or risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used for assessing risk of bias, and the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence and summarise conclusions. Results 12 reports (13 randomised trials) were included. There was ""high quality"" evidence that paracetamol is ineffective for reducing pain intensity (weighted mean difference -0.5, 95% confidence interval -2.9 to 1.9) and disability (0.4, -1.7 to 2.5) or improving quality of life (0.4, -0.9 to 1.7) in the short term in people with low back pain. For hip or knee osteoarthritis there was ""high quality"" evidence that paracetamol provides a significant, although not clinically important, effect on pain (-3.7, -5.5 to -1.9) and disability (-2.9, -4.9 to -0.9) in the short term. The number of patients reporting any adverse event (risk ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.1), any serious adverse event (1.2, 0.7 to 2.1), or withdrawn from the study because of adverse events (1.2, 0.9 to 1.5) was similar in the paracetamol and placebo groups. Patient adherence to treatment (1.0, 0.9 to 1.1) and use of rescue medication (0.7, 0.4 to 1.3) was also similar between groups. ""High quality"" evidence showed that patients taking paracetamol are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests (3.8, 1.9 to 7.4), but the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain. Conclusions Paracetamol is ineffective in the treatment of low back pain and provides minimal short term benefit for people with osteoarthritis. These results support the reconsideration of recommendations to use paracetamol for patients with low back pain and osteoarthritis of the hip or knee in clinical practice guidelines.   MP: Background. Our objective was to develop an instrument to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews, building upon previous tools, empirical evidence and expert consensus. Methods. A 37-item assessment tool was formed by combining 1) the enhanced Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ), 2) a checklist created by Sacks, and 3) three additional items recently judged to be of methodological importance. This tool was applied to 99 paper-based and 52 electronic systematic reviews. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify underlying components. The results were considered by methodological experts using a nominal group technique aimed at item reduction and design of an assessment tool with face and content validity. Results. The factor analysis identified 11 components. From each component, one item was selected by the nominal group. The resulting instrument was judged to have face and content validity. Conclusion. A measurement tool for the 'assessment of multiple systematic reviews' (AMSTAR) was developed. The tool consists of 11 items and has good face and content validity for measuring the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Additional studies are needed with a focus on the reproducibility and construct validity of AMSTAR, before strong recommendations can be made on its use.   MP: Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health issue because it causes chronic pain, reduces physical function and diminishes quality of life. Ageing of the population and increased global prevalence of obesity are anticipated to dramatically increase the prevalence of knee OA and its associated impairments. No cure for knee OA is known, but exercise therapy is among the dominant non-pharmacological interventions recommended by international guidelines. Objectives: To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with knee OA in terms of reduced joint pain or improved physical function and quality of life. Search methods: Five electronic databases were searched, up until May 2013. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assigning individuals and comparing groups treated with some form of land-based therapeutic exercise (as opposed to exercise conducted in the water) with a non-exercise group or a non-treatment control group. Data collection and analysis: Three teams of two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each study and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. We conducted analyses on continuous outcomes (pain, physical function and quality of life) immediately after treatment and on dichotomous outcomes (proportion of study withdrawals) at the end of the study; we also conducted analyses on the sustained effects of exercise on pain and function (two to six months, and longer than six months). Main results: In total, we extracted data from 54 studies. Overall, 19 (20%) studies reported adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment and adequately accounted for incomplete outcome data; we considered these studies to have an overall low risk of bias. Studies were largely free from selection bias, but research results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias, as only four of the RCTs reported blinding of participants to treatment allocation, and, although most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self-reported. High-quality evidence from 44 trials (3537 participants) indicates that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.59) immediately after treatment. Pain was estimated at 44 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (0 indicated no pain) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 12 points (95% CI 10 to 15 points). Moderate-quality evidence from 44 trials (3913 participants) showed that exercise improved physical function (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.64) immediately after treatment. Physical function was estimated at 38 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (0 indicated no loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise improved physical function by an equivalent of 10 points (95% CI 8 to 13 points). High-quality evidence from 13 studies (1073 participants) revealed that exercise improved quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40) immediately after treatment. Quality of life was estimated at 43 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (100 indicated best quality of life) in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by an equivalent of 4 points (95% CI 2 to 5 points). High-quality evidence from 45 studies (4607 participants) showed a comparable likelihood of withdrawal from exercise allocation (event rate 14%) compared with the control group (event rate 15%), and this difference was not significant: odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.15). Eight studies reported adverse events, all of which were related to increased knee or low back pain attributed to the exercise intervention provided. No study reported a serious adverse event. In addition, 12 included studies provided two to six-month post-treatment sustainability data on 1468 participants for knee pain and on 1279 (10 studies) participants for physical function. These studies indicated sustainability of treatment effect for pain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.14), with an equivalent reduction of 6 (3 to 9) points on 0 to 100-point scale, and of physical function (SMD -0.15 95% CI -0.26 to -0.04), with an equivalent improvement of 3 (1 to 5) points on 0 to 100-point scale. Marked variability was noted across included studies among participants recruited, symptom duration, exercise interventions assessed and important aspects of study methodology. Individually delivered programmes tended to result in greater reductions in pain and improvements in physical function, compared to class-based exercise programmes or home-based programmes; however between-study heterogeneity was marked within the individually provided treatment delivery subgroup. Authors' conclusions: High-quality evidence indicates that land-based therapeutic exercise provides short-term benefit that is sustained for at least two to six months after cessation of formal treatment in terms of reduced knee pain, and moderate-quality evidence shows improvement in physical function among people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect would be considered moderate (immediate) to small (two to six months) but comparable with estimates reported for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Confidence intervals around demonstrated pooled results for pain reduction and improvement in physical function do not exclude a minimal clinically important treatment effect. Since the participants in most trials were aware of their treatment, this may have contributed to their improvement. Despite the lack of blinding we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of performance or detection bias. This reflects our belief that further research in this area is unlikely to change the findings of our review.  MP: Background: Use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat chronic musculoskeletal conditions has become widely accepted because they can provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events. This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults', originally published in Issue 9, 2012. Objectives: To review the evidence from randomised, double-blind, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and our own in-house database; the date of the last search was February 2016. We also searched the references lists of included studies and reviews, and sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers' web sites. Selection criteria: We included randomised, double-blind, active or inert carrier (placebo) controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain of moderate or severe intensity. Studies had to meet stringent quality criteria and there had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to carrier or other active treatment. We were particularly interested to compare different formulations (gel, cream, plaster) of individual NSAIDs. The primary outcome was 'clinical success', defined as at least a 50% reduction in pain, or an equivalent measure such as a 'very good' or 'excellent' global assessment of treatment, or 'none' or 'slight' pain on rest or movement, measured on a categorical scale. Main results: We identified five new studies for this update, which now has information from 10,631 participants in 39 studies, a 38% increase in participants from the earlier review; 33 studies compared a topical NSAID with carrier. All studies examined topical NSAIDs for treatment of osteoarthritis, and for pooled analyses studies were generally of moderate or high methodological quality, although we considered some at risk of bias from short duration and small size. In studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen were significantly more effective than carrier for reducing pain; about 60% of participants had much reduced pain. With topical diclofenac, the NNT for clinical success in six trials (2343 participants) was 9.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1 to 16) (moderate quality evidence). With topical ketoprofen, the NNT for clinical success in four trials (2573 participants) was 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3) (moderate quality evidence). There was too little information for analysis of other individual topical NSAIDs compared with carrier. Few trials compared a topical NSAID to an oral NSAID, but overall they showed similar efficacy (low quality evidence). These efficacy results were almost completely derived from people with knee osteoarthritis. There was an increase in local adverse events (mostly mild skin reactions) with topical diclofenac compared with carrier or oral NSAIDs, but no increase with topical ketoprofen (moderate quality evidence). Reporting of systemic adverse events (such as gastrointestinal upsets) was poor, but where reported there was no difference between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were infrequent and not different between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Clinical success with carrier occurred commonly - in around half the participants in studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks. Both direct and indirect comparison of clinical success with oral placebo indicates that response rates with carrier (topical placebo) are about twice those seen with oral placebo. A substantial amount of data from completed, unpublished studies was unavailable (up to 6000 participants). To the best of our knowledge, much of this probably relates to formulations that have never been marketed. Authors' conclusions: Topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen can provide good levels of pain relief beyond carrier in osteoarthritis for a minority of people, but there is no evidence for other chronic painful conditions. There is emerging evidence that at least some of the substantial placebo effects seen in longer duration studies derive from effects imparted by the NSAID carrier itself, and that NSAIDs add to that.  MP: Objective: To compare the effectiveness of acupuncture with other relevant physical treatments for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis. Design: Systematic review with network meta-analysis, to allow comparison of treatments within a coherent framework. Comprehensive searches were undertaken up to January 2013 to identify randomised controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, which reported pain. Results: Of 156 eligible studies, 114 trials (covering 22 treatments and 9,709 patients) provided data suitable for analysis. Most trials studied short-term effects and many were classed as being of poor quality with high risk of bias, commonly associated with lack of blinding (which was sometimes impossible to achieve). End of treatment results showed that eight interventions: interferential therapy, acupuncture, TENS, pulsed electrical stimulation, balneotherapy, aerobic exercise, sham acupuncture, and muscle-strengthening exercise produced a statistically significant reduction in pain when compared with standard care. In a sensitivity analysis of satisfactory and good quality studies, most studies were of acupuncture (11 trials) or muscle-strengthening exercise (9 trials); both interventions were statistically significantly better than standard care, with acupuncture being statistically significantly better than muscle-strengthening exercise (standardised mean difference: 0.49, 95% credible interval 0.00-0.98). Conclusions: As a summary of the current available research, the network meta-analysis results indicate that acupuncture can be considered as one of the more effective physical treatments for alleviating osteoarthritis knee pain in the short-term. However, much of the evidence in this area of research is of poor quality, meaning there is uncertainty about the efficacy of many physical treatments.

MP: Since the early discovery of the antireflection properties of insect compound eyes, new examples of natural antireflective coatings have been rare. Here, we report the fabrication and optical characterization of a biologically inspired antireflective surface that emulates the intricate surface architectures of leafhopper-produced brochosomes-soccer ball-like microscale granules with nanoscale indentations. Our method utilizes double-layer colloidal crystal templates in conjunction with site-specific electrochemical growth to create these structures, and is compatible with various materials including metals, metal oxides, and conductive polymers. These brochosome coatings (BCs) can be designed to exhibit strong omnidirectional antireflective performance of wavelengths from 250 to 2000 nm, comparable to the state-of-the-art antireflective coatings. Our results provide evidence for the use of brochosomes as a camouflage coating against predators of leafhoppers or their eggs. The discovery of the antireflective function of BCs may find applications in solar energy harvesting, imaging, and sensing devices.  MP: Background: Pairwise meta-analyses have shown beneficial effects of individual dietary approaches on blood pressure but their comparative effects have not been established. Objective: Therefore we performed a systematic review of different dietary intervention trials and estimated the aggregate blood pressure effects through network meta-analysis including hypertensive and pre-hypertensive patients. Design: PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were searched until June 2017. The inclusion criteria were defined as follows: i) Randomized trial with a dietary approach; ii) hypertensive and pre-hypertensive adult patients; and iii) minimum intervention period of 12 weeks. In order to determine the pooled effect of each intervention relative to each of the other intervention for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), random effects network meta-analysis was performed. Results: A total of 67 trials comparing 13 dietary approaches (DASH, low-fat, moderate-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, Palaeolithic, vegetarian, low-GI/GL, low-sodium, Nordic, Tibetan, and control) enrolling 17,230 participants were included. In the network meta-analysis, the DASH, Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, Palaeolithic, high-protein, low-glycaemic index, low-sodium, and low-fat dietary approaches were significantly more effective in reducing SBP (−8.73 to −2.32 mmHg) and DBP (−4.85 to −1.27 mmHg) compared to a control diet. According to the SUCRAs, the DASH diet was ranked the most effective dietary approach in reducing SBP (90%) and DBP (91%), followed by the Palaeolithic, and the low-carbohydrate diet (ranked 3rd for SBP) or the Mediterranean diet (ranked 3rd for DBP). For most comparisons, the credibility of evidence was rated very low to moderate, with the exception for the DASH vs. the low-fat dietary approach for which the quality of evidence was rated high. Conclusion: The present network meta-analysis suggests that the DASH dietary approach might be the most effective dietary measure to reduce blood pressure among hypertensive and pre-hypertensive patients based on high quality evidence.  MP: Objective To illustrate and discuss current and proposed new concepts of effect size (ES) quantification and significance, with a focus on statistical and clinical/subjective interpretation and supported by empirical examples. Study Design and Settings Different methods for determining minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) are reviewed, applied to practical examples (pain score differences in knee osteoarthritis), and further developed. Their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages are illustrated and discussed. Results Empirical score differences between verum and placebo become statistically significant if sample sizes are sufficiently large. MCIDs, by contrast, are defined by patients’ perceptions. MCIDs obtained by the most common “mean change method” can be expressed as absolute or relative scores, as different ES parameters, and as the optimal cutoff point on the receiver operating characteristic curve. They can further be modeled by linear and logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusion Absolute and relative MCIDs are easy to interpret and apply to data of investigative studies. MCIDs expressed as effect sizes reduce bias, which mainly results from dependency on the baseline score. Multivariate linear and logistic regression modeling further reduces bias. Anchor-based methods use clinical/subjective perception to define MCIDs and should be clearly differentiated from distribution-based methods that provide statistical significance only.  MP: Network meta-analysis (NMA) compares several interventions that are linked in a network of comparative studies and estimates the relative treatment effects between all treatments, using both direct and indirect evidence. NMA is increasingly used for decision making in health care, however, a user-friendly system to evaluate the confidence that can be placed in the results of NMA is currently lacking. This paper is a tutorial describing the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) web application, which is based on the framework developed by Salanti et al (2014, PLOS One, 9, e99682) and refined by Nikolakopoulou et al (2019, bioRxiv). Six domains that affect the level of confidence in the NMA results are considered: (a) within-study bias, (b) reporting bias, (c) indirectness, (d) imprecision, (e) heterogeneity, and (f) incoherence. CINeMA is freely available and open-source and no login is required. In the configuration step users upload their data, produce network plots and define the analysis and effect measure. The dataset should include assessments of study-level risk of bias and judgments on indirectness. CINeMA calls the netmeta routine in R to estimate relative effects and heterogeneity. Users are then guided through a systematic evaluation of the six domains. In this way reviewers assess the level of concerns for each relative treatment effect from NMA as giving rise to “no concerns,” “some concerns,” or “major concerns” in each of the six domains, which are graphically summarized on the report page for all effect estimates. Finally, judgments across the domains are summarized into a single confidence rating (“high,” “moderate,” “low,” or “very low”). In conclusion, the user-friendly web-based CINeMA platform provides a transparent framework to evaluate evidence from systematic reviews with multiple interventions.   MP: Background: Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few hip OA treatments have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy which aims to treat disease by inserting very thin needles at specific points on the body. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture in patients with hip OA. Search methods: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase all through March 2018. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, another active treatment, or no specific treatment; and RCTs that evaluated acupuncture as an addition to another treatment. Major outcomes were pain and function at the short term (i.e. < 3 months after randomization) and adverse events. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: Six RCTs with 413 participants were included. Four RCTs included only people with OA of the hip, and two included a mix of people with OA of the hip and knee. All RCTs included primarily older participants, with a mean age range from 61 to 67 years, and a mean duration of hip OA pain from two to eight years. Approximately two-thirds of participants were women. Two RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture; the other four RCTs were not blinded. All results were evaluated at short term (i.e. four to nine weeks after randomization). In the two RCTs that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture, the sham acupuncture control interventions were judged believable, but each sham acupuncture intervention was also judged to have a risk of weak acupuncture-specific effects, due to placement of non-penetrating needles at the correct acupuncture points in one RCT, and the use of penetrating needles not inserted at the correct points in the other RCT. For these two sham-controlled RCTs, the risk of bias was low for all outcomes. The combined analysis of two sham-controlled RCTs gave moderate quality evidence of little or no effect in reduction in pain for acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture. Due to the small sample sizes in the studies, the confidence interval includes both the possibility of moderate benefit and the possibility of no effect of acupuncture (120 participants; Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) -0.13, (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.49 to 0.22); 2.1 points greater improvement with acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture on 100 point scale (i.e., absolute percent change -2.1% (95% CI -7.9% to 3.6%)); relative percent change -4.1% (95% CI -15.6% to 7.0%)). Estimates of effect were similar for function (120 participants; SMD -0.15, (95% CI -0.51 to 0.21)). No pooled estimate, representative of the two sham-controlled RCTs, could be calculated or reported for the quality of life outcome. The four other RCTs were unblinded comparative effectiveness RCTs, which compared (additional) acupuncture to four different active control treatments. There was low quality evidence that addition of acupuncture to the routine primary care that RCT participants were receiving from their physicians was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, compared to the routine primary physician care alone, in pain (1 RCT; 137 participants; mean percent difference -22.9% (95% CI -29.2% to -16.6%); relative percent difference -46.5% (95% CI -59.3% to -33.7%)) and function (mean percent difference -19.0% (95% CI -24.41 to -13.59); relative percent difference -38.6% (95% CI -49.6% to -27.6%)). There was no statistically significant difference for mental quality of life and acupuncture showed a small, significant benefit for physical quality of life. The effects of acupuncture compared with either advice plus exercise or NSAIDs are uncertain. We are also uncertain whether acupuncture plus patient education improves pain, function, and quality of life, when compared to patient education alone. In general, the overall quality of the evidence for the four comparative effectiveness RCTs was low to very low, mainly due to the potential for biased reporting of patient-assessed outcomes due to lack of blinding and sparse data. Information on safety was reported in four RCTs. Two RCTs reported minor side effects of acupuncture, which were primarily minor bruising, bleeding, or pain at needle insertion sites. Four RCTs reported on adverse events, and none reported any serious adverse events attributed to acupuncture. Authors' conclusions: Acupuncture probably has little or no effect in reducing pain or improving function relative to sham acupuncture in people with hip osteoarthritis. Due to the small sample size in the studies, the confidence intervals include both the possibility of moderate benefits and the possibility of no effect of acupuncture. One unblinded trial found that acupuncture as an addition to routine primary physician care was associated with benefits on pain and function. However, these reported benefits are likely due at least partially to RCT participants' greater expectations of benefit from acupuncture. Possible side effects associated with acupuncture treatment were minor.   MP: Purpose To determine (1) whether platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection significantly improves validated patient-reported outcomes in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) at 6 and 12 months postinjection, (2) differences in outcomes between PRP and corticosteroid injections or viscosupplementation or placebo injections at 6 and 12 months postinjection, and (3) similarities and differences in outcomes based on the PRP formulations used in the analyzed studies. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and Sport Discus were searched for English-language, level I evidence, human in vivo studies on the treatment of symptomatic knee OA with intra-articular PRP compared with other options, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. A quality assessment of all articles was performed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (average, 83.3/100), and outcomes were analyzed using 2-proportion z-tests. Results Six articles (739 patients, 817 knees, 39% males, mean age of 59.9 years, with 38 weeks average follow-up) were analyzed. All studies met minimal clinical important difference criteria and showed significant improvements in statistical and clinical outcomes, including pain, physical function, and stiffness, with PRP. All but one study showed significant differences in clinical outcomes between PRP and hyaluronic acid (HA) or PRP and placebo in pain and function. Average pretreatment Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were 52.36 and 52.05 for the PRP and HA groups, respectively (P =.420). Mean post-treatment WOMAC scores for PRP were significantly better than for HA at 3 to 6 months (28.5 and 43.4, respectively; P =.0008) and at 6 to 12 months (22.8 and 38.1, respectively; P =.0062). None of the included studies used corticosteroids. Conclusions In patients with symptomatic knee OA, PRP injection results in significant clinical improvements up to 12 months postinjection. Clinical outcomes and WOMAC scores are significantly better after PRP versus HA at 3 to 12 months postinjection. There is limited evidence for comparing leukocyte-rich versus leukocyte-poor PRP or PRP versus steroids in this study. Level of Evidence Level I, systematic review of Level I studies.  MP: "
"Background The role of iron biomarkers and iron intake in the susceptibility to lung cancer is unclear. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, to assess the relationship between iron levels in the body or iron intake and the risk of lung cancer.  Method This review is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD 42020199776). PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane were used to search for studies assessing the relationship between iron and lung cancer, up to July 15, 2021. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was carried out to determine if there was a correlation between iron biomarkers/intakes and the risk of lung cancer.  Result Twenty articles were included. Pooled analyses demonstrated that serum ferritin concentrations and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than in healthy controls (ferritin: standardized mean differences [SMD], 0.235, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.129, 0.341, I2 = 32.1 %; TSAT: SMD, 0.07, 95 % CI, 0.018, 0.121, I2 = 0 %). In contrast, serum transferrin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with lung cancer than in healthy controls (SMD, −0.591, 95 % CI, −1.18, −0.003, I2 = 87.7 %). No significant effects of serum iron, lung tissue iron, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) ferritin, or iron intake (total iron, dietary iron, heme iron, or non-heme iron) were found on lung cancer incidence.  Conclusion Among the different iron biomarkers analyzed, a trend in association was only detected with serum ferritin, TSAT and transferrin concentration and no associations were found between iron intakes and the risk of lung cancer. However, more prospective studies are needed to strengthen the current evidence.","MP: Objective. Many studies have identified causal and promotive roles of oxidative stress (OxS) and oxidative damage caused by OxS in the occurrence and progression of cancer. Many biomarkers in the blood circulation of patients may change correspondingly with the development of tumors. This study is aimed at investigating the correlation between OxS and serum trace element (TE) levels of patients with different types of cancer. Methods. 1143 different types of cancer patients and 178 healthy controls from Mar. 2018 to Aug. 2020 in Mianyang Central Hospital were involved in this study. Their levels of OxS parameters (including total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and oxidant stress index (OSI)) and the concentrations of serum TEs (including Cu, Zn, Fe, and Se) were determined. Results. Compared with healthy controls, all types of cancer patients had higher TOS level (all Padj<0.001) and OSI level (z=6.2289.909, all Padj<0.001) and lower TAS level (all Padj<0.001). Compared with healthy controls, the changes of four TE levels in serum were different in different types of cancer patients, among which Cu increased in all groups, but there was no statistical difference in gastric and brain cancer; Se decreased in all groups, but there was no statistical difference in gastric, colorectal, esophageal, and other cancer; Zn was significantly decreased in breast cancer patients (Padj<0.001); there was no statistical difference in the change of Fe in liver, kidney, and other cancer. Spearman correlation showed that the change of Cu concentration was most closely related to the three OxS parameters and was strongly correlated in the observed several types of tumors (rs>0.6). Multinomial logistic regression showed that the risks of different tumors are related to the level change of multiple TEs and OxS parameters (ORTOS=1.192.82, OROSI=2.564.70, ORTAS=0.200.46, ORCu=0.731.44, ORZn=0.810.91, ORFe=0.681.18, and ORSe=0.220.45, all P<0.006). Conclusions. The OxS exists in the occurrence and development of cancer, which may be related to the changes of certain trace elements. In order to evaluate OxS correctly, it is necessary to detect TAS and TOS and at the same time, their ratio OSI should be detected. Assessment of markers representing the overall level of OxS and TEs may guarantee improved the monitoring of disease occurrence and development risk in cancer patients.  MP: Background Lung cancer is the most common adult malignancy accounting for the largest proportion of cancer related deaths. Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element and is a component of several major metabolic pathways playing an important role in many physiological processes. In this study we evaluated the association between Fe concentration in serum, iron metabolism parameters and genetic variaton in 7 genes involved in iron metabolism and anti-oxidative processes with the incidence of lung cancer in Poland.  Materials and methods The study included 200 lung cancer patients and 200 matched healthy control subjects. We analyzed serum iron concentration and iron metabolism parameters (TIBC, UIBC, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation), and genotyped seven variants in seven genes: HFE, TFR1, HAMP, TF, SOD2, CAT and GPX1.  Results Lung cancer patients compared to their matched controls had significantly higher mean serum iron level (p = 0.01), ferritin level (p = 0.007) and TIBC (p = 0.006). Analysis revealed that higher concentration of iron and ferritin (IVth quartile) compared to the lower concentration (Ist quartile) was associated with over 2-fold increased lung cancer incidence. We also found that higher transferrin saturation (p = 0.01) and lower TIBC (p<0.01) are associated with better survival of lung cancer patients. The analysis of polymorphisms in iron related genes did not reveal a significant difference between lung cancer patients and controls. However, rs10421768 in HAMP showed a borderline statistically significant correlation with lung cancer risk (OR = 2.83, p = 0.05).  Conclusions The results of this case control study indicate that higher body iron represented by higher Fe and ferritin levels may be associated with lung cancer incidence. Rs10421768 in HAMP may be associated with about 3-times higher lung cancer risk. Higher Fe body content may be associated with better survival of lung cancer patients.  MP: While experimental evidence suggests potential carcinogenic effects of increased iron load, there is a lack of data on iron status and cancer risk from epidemiological studies. Here, we evaluated prediagnostic serum concentrations of ferritin, iron and transferrin as well as transferrin saturation (TSAT) in relation to cancer risk and mortality in a prospective study by multivariable Cox regression analyses. A case–cohort sample of the population-based EPIC-Heidelberg Study including a random subcohort (n = 2738) and incident cases of breast cancer (n = 627), prostate cancer (n = 554), lung cancer (n = 195), colorectal cancer (n = 256) and cancer death (n = 759) was used. Ferritin levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk in the multivariable Cox regression model, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 [95% confidence interval: 0.49, 0.92] for women in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. Neither ferritin nor the other markers of iron status were significantly associated with colorectal, prostate or lung cancer risk. An inverse association was observed between ferritin and total cancer mortality (HR: 0.70 [0.53, 0.92]). There were no significant overall associations between serum iron, transferrin or TSAT and cancer mortality. The present findings do not support the notion of increased iron load constituting a cancer risk factor in the general population. By contrast, our analyses revealed inverse associations between ferritin levels and breast cancer risk as well as cancer mortality.   MP: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the concentrations of metals differ among patients with and without lung cancer with different smoking status and living in industrialized environments. We also evaluated the relationships between metals and blood parameters including hematocrit level (Hct), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), red (RBC) and white (WBC) blood cells numbers. Concentrations of metals were measured with AAS (copper-Cu, iron-Fe, magnesium-Mg, zinc-Zn) and CV-AAS (mercury-Hg). Neither smoking status nor industrialization could be considered as a significant factor for metals accumulation in blood, lungs and tumor tissues, with the exception of mercury which differed in the aspect of industrialization. According to the type of the disease, Fe, Hg and Mg concentrations differed significantly in lungs. Correlations between metals and blood parameters were observed. Additionally, concentrations of Mg, Cu and Zn were correlated between lungs and tumor tissue of patients with cancer as well as they all were related to each other in lungs, tumor and blood tissues.  MP: Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the expression levels of serum ferritin (SF) and investigate the correlation between SF expression levels and clinical characteristics as well as the efficacy to platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and Methods: Electrochemiluminescence method was used to determine the expression levels of SF in the peripheral blood of 46 advanced NSCLC patients and 63 healthy subjects. Results: The expression levels of SF in healthy subjects were significantly lower than those in patients with advanced NSCLC patients (t = -3.279,P = 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between SF expression levels and distant metastasis, regional lymph node metastasis, respectively (P < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between SF expression levels and sex, age, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, smoking history, pathological type, tumor location and tumor-node-metastasis stage (All P > 0.05). The overall response rate to platinum-based chemotherapy was 57.1% (12/21) in normal SF expression levels group, which was significantly higher than that was 28% (7/25) in high SF expression levels group (χ2 = 3.998,P = 0.046). Conclusions: SF may be a valuable blood marker for predicting the tumor progression and the efficacy of platinum-based therapies for advanced NSCLC patients.  MP: Objective: Increased iron overload, whether or not owing to the presence of the haemochromatosis genotype C282Y/C282Y, may be associated with an increased risk of cancer. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that elevated transferrin saturation levels (as a proxy for iron overload) and haemochromatosis genotype C282Y/C282Y are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Methods: We conducted a population-based study of 8763 individuals, of whom 1417 developed a first cancer during 15years of follow-up, and a meta-analysis. We stratified absolute 10-year risk of cancer by smoking status, an important risk factor. Results: In women, transferrin saturation above 60% versus below 50% was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-6.5; P<0.001) for any cancer; risk of liver cancer was increased in both women and men. In women, the corresponding absolute 10-year risk of any cancer was 34% and 30% in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. In men, haemochromatosis genotype C282Y/C282Y versus wild type/wild type was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.7 (95% CI: 1.2-12; P=0.01) for any cancer, with a similar trend in women. In men, the corresponding absolute 10-year risk of cancer was 39% and 27% in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Other haemochromatosis genotypes were not associated with increased risk of cancer in women or men. From the meta-analysis, the odds ratio of any cancer for transferrin saturation ≥60% versus a reference group was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2-1.8) for women and men combined. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that elevated transferrin saturation levels in women and haemochromatosis genotype C282Y/C282Y in men are associated with increased risk of cancer. Thus, our results support the implementation of cancer screening programmes in patients with iron overload or with C282Y/C282Y.   MP: Objective: We aimed to determine the relationship between some mineral, trace element and heavy metal levels in the patients of lung cancer by measuring serum levels of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg). Methods: A total of 50 lung cancer and human health (30 lung cancer and 20 healthy human) were included in the study. Venous blood samples of each lung cancer were obtained, and serum Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Cd, Co, Mn, Mg levels were analysed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer measurements. Results: Mg value measured in lung cancer group were lower than the control group and this was statistically significant (P<0.01). Serum Cu level was significantly lower with lung cancer compared to healthy human (P<0.01). Pb level was significantly higher than those of controls (P<0.01). The serum Zn level was significantly lower in serum of lung cancer group than controls (P<0.01). Serum Mn and Co levels were found increased in lung cancer group than controls (P<0.01). Cd value was higher in lung cancer but it was not statistically significant (p>0.01). The mean concentration of Fe in the serum of lung cancer patients was higher than in the controls, but the difference was not significant (p>0.01). There was a positive correlation between Cd and Pb level, and between Mn and Fe levels in lung cancer. There was a negative correlation between Co and Zn levels of healthy human. There was a negative correlation between Co and Mg levels of lung cancer. Conclusions: Serum Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mg, Co, Mn and Cd might be play a role in the patients of lung cancers. Zn may protective as potent lung cancer. In addition, it is suggested that low levels of zinc can induce the pathogenesis of lung cancer.  MP: The aim of this study is to investigate if serum iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ferritin levels are useful to differentiate lung cancer from benign pulmonary diseases, and also to test the accuracy of hypothesis of ""ferritin accumulation in the tumor area"". Patients prospectively scheduled for diagnostic bronchoscopy were included and divided into three diagnosis groups: lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis and other benign pulmonary diseases. Sixty six men and 7 women, 73 patients were included. Statistically significant difference was not found among three groups for serum iron, iron binding capacity and ferritin levels (p=0.151, p=0.972, p=0.278). The difference was statistically insignificant for BAL ferritin levels between three groups (p=0.584). Mean BAL ferritin level was 73.56 ng/ml in central and 31.54 ng/ml in peripheric lung cancer (p=0.087). The mean serum iron level was lower in stage IV and III compared to Stage II and I patients (p=0.004). None of other measurements differed according to tumor stages. In lung cancer group, the type of tumor had no effect on serum iron, iron binding capacity, and serum and BAL ferritin levels. In conclusion; serum ferritin, serum iron, serum iron binding capacity and BAL ferritin measures do not help in differentiating lung cancer from benign pulmonary diseases. The histological types, stages and localization of lung cancer do not effect BAL ferritin levels. The results of the study did not support the hypothesis of ferritin accumulation in the tumor area.  MP: Objectives: To assess the diagnostic value of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) ferritin as a lung tumor marker by comparing serum and BALF ferritin concentrations in patients with peripheral lung cancer versus control subjects with benign lung disease, and to examine the theory of ferritin compartmentalization around the tumor area by comparing ferritin concentrations in serum and bilateral (affected and unaffected side) BALF in cancer patients. Methods: Four groups of patients were investigated: 10 control nonsmokers, 10 control smokers, 10 smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 22 patients with primary bronchogenic carcinoma. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in all subjects (both sides in 13 oncological patients, one side in the others) and samples of BALF and blood were submitted to biochemical analysis. Results: As a lung tumor marker, BALF ferritin showed 54% sensitivity and 93% specificity and serum ferritin 22% sensitivity and 93% specificity. A significant difference was observed between the two sides in the cancer patients (p = 0.033), and between BALF ferritin from the affected side and COPD patients (p = 0.025). Greater differences were obtained when BALF ferritin in the affected side of cancer patients was compared with values in both control nonsmokers (p < 0.0001) and control smokers (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings seem to confirm the relative diagnostic value of BALF ferritin as a lung tumor marker and the theory of ferritin compartmentalization. However, further studies are required to clarify the relations between iron and ferritin on the one hand and inflammation, tumorigenesis and host response on the other.  MP: This study examined the effect of an acute-phase response on plasma trace element concentrations of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In normal subjects (n = 13) and NSCLC patients (n = 22), fasting concentrations of albumin. C-reactive protein, the trace elements iron, zinc, copper and selenium, and their associated proteins transferrin, albumin, ceruloplasmin, and glutathione peroxidase were measured. The NSCLC patients were subdivided into two equal groups depending on whether they had a C- reactive protein concentration <35 mg/l (Group 1) or >35 mg/l (Group 2). Circulating zinc, iron, and transferrin concentrations were significantly lower in NSCLC Group 1 than in the control group (p < 0.05). Circulating concentrations of iron, zinc, and the binding proteins transferrin and albumin were significantly lower in NSCLC Group 2 than in the control group and NSCLC Group 1 (zinc not significantly different) (p < 0.01). In contrast, circulating concentrations of copper and its binding protein ceruloplasmin were significantly increased in NSCLC Group 2 compared with NSCLC Group 1 and the control group (p < 0.01). Additionally, plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in NSCLC Group 2 than in NSCLC Group 1 and the control group. In the NSCLC patients there were significant negative correlations between concentrations of C-reactive protein and iron, transferrin, zinc, albumin, and selenium (p < 0.05). Furthermore, there were also significant positive correlations between C- reactive protein and copper (r = 0.788, p < 0.001) and ceruloplasmin (r = 0.831, p < 0.001) concentrations. The presence of an acute-phase response has implications for the interpretation of circulating trace element concentrations, the status of patients with NSCLC, and supplementation with trace elements in patients with NSCLC.  MP: Copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron were measured in serum and lung tissue - tumor mass and histologically nonneoplastic tissue - from lung cancer patients and compared with serum cocentration in healthy subjects and control lung tissue obtained from patients with nonmalignant lung disease. Lung cancer patients showed a significant increase in serum Cu and Cu/Zn ratio levels and decrease in serum Zn and Fe concentrations. These findings were correlated with TNM stage of the disease, but not with histologic type of tumor. Malignant lung tissue showed a higher level of Cu, Ca, Mg, and Cu/Zn ratio and lower Zn level than that found in control samples, as well as an increase in Cu, Mg and Cu/Zn ratio concentrations with regard to histologically nonneoplastic tissue samples from the same patient. Tissue concentration of trace metals was not significantly influenced either by histologic type of tumor or clinical TNM stage. Significant correlation coefficients between serum and tissue trace metal levels were not found.  MP: The concentrations of trace elements are closely related to tumor genesis, progression, and therapy. In order to establish the extent to which trace elements apply to lung cancer, 15 trace elements were determined in 60 lung tissue samples from residents of Xuanwei and Fuyuan, two counties with extremely high lung cancer incidences in Yunnan province, China. The results indicated that the levels of V, Fe, Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, Se, and Pb in the lung cancer tissues were significantly different from those in benign tissues. Among the eight elements, the levels of V, Fe, Zn, and Cd in the lung cancer tissues were lower than those in the benign tissues, while those of Ni, Cu, Se, and Pb were higher. Multiple conditional logistic regression showed that among the 15 elements, Cu, Pb (β∈>∈0, OR∈>∈1), and Zn (β∈< ∈0, OR∈<∈1) were closely related to the lung cancer. Cu and Pb were classified as risk factors for local lung cancer and Zn was identified as a protective factor. The results obtained will provide dietary suggestions in terms of how to reduce lung cancer risks by appropriately balancing the intakes of certain trace elements especially for individuals who are from those two counties.   MP: Appalachian Kentucky (App KY) leads the nation in lung cancer incidence and mortality. Trace elements, such as As, have been associated with lung cancers in other regions of the country and we hypothesized that a population-based study would reveal higher trace element concentrations in App KY individuals with cancer compared to controls. Using toenail and drinking water trace element concentrations, this study investigated a possible association between lung cancer incidence and trace-element exposure in residents of this region. This population-based case-control study had 520 subjects, and 367 subjects provided toenail samples. Additionally, we explored the relationship between toenail and fingernail trace-element concentrations to determine if fingernails could be used as a surrogate for toenails when patients are unable to provide toenail samples. We found that, contrary to our initial hypothesis, trace element concentrations (Al, As, Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, Se, and Pb) were not higher in cancer cases than controls with the exception of Zn where concentrations were slightly higher in cases. In fact, univariate logistic regression models showed that individuals with lower concentrations of several elements (Al, Mn, Cr, and Se) were more likely to have lung cancer, although only Mn was significant in multivariate models which controlled for confounding factors. While drinking water concentrations of Al, Cr and Co were positively related to cancer incidence in univariate models, only Co remained significant in multivariate models. However, since the drinking water concentrations were extremely low and not reflected in the toenail concentrations, the significance of this finding is unclear. We also found that fingernail concentrations were not consistently predictive of toenail concentrations, indicating that fingernails should not be used as surrogates for toenails in future studies.

"Background Prostate cancer is a major malignancy, affecting men, worldwide. The protective effect of dietary or supplemental lycopene on prostate cancer has been reported in several studies; however, the findings are equivocal.  Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplemental lycopene on PSA level, by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.  Methods We searched online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, up to 9 Jun 2020, to obtain relevant publications. The publication search was not limited by language or date.  Results A total of 1036 records were identified in the systematic search; from these, 9 were included in the systematic review and 6 in meta-analysis. The pooled analysis of the 6 studies showed no significant differences in PSA levels in subjects treated with lycopene or tomato extract containing lycopene (WMD= −0.12 ng/ml; 95% CI: −0.62, 0.38 ng/ml; P = 0.64) compared to the control.  Conclusion Overall, tomato extracts or lycopene treatment yielded no significant effect on PSA level compared to the control. However, more consistent clinical trials, with larger sample sizes, are required to better discern the actual effect of tomato extract or lycopene on PSA level.  ","MP: Background & aims The effect of lycopene-containing foods in prostate cancer development remains undetermined. We tested whether a lycopene-rich tomato intervention could reduce the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients. Methods Prior to their curative treatment, 79 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a nutritional intervention with either 1) tomato products containing 30 mg lycopene per day; 2) tomato products plus selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, soy isoflavones, grape/pomegranate juice, and green/black tea (tomato-plus); or 3) control diet for 3 weeks. Results The main analysis, which included patients in all risk categories, did not reveal differences in changes of PSA-values between the intervention and control groups. Post-hoc, exploratory analyses within intermediate risk (n = 41) patients based on tumor classification and Gleason score post-surgery, revealed that median PSA decreased significantly in the tomato group as compared to controls (−2.9% and +6.5% respectively, p = 0.016). In separate post-hoc analyses, we observed that median PSA-values decreased by 1% in patients with the highest increases in plasma lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid, compared to an 8.5% increase in the patients with the lowest increase in lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid (p = 0.003). Also, PSA decreased in patients with the highest increase in lycopene alone (p = 0.009). Conclusions Three week nutritional interventions with tomato-products alone or in combination with selenium and n-3 fatty acids lower PSA in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Our observation suggests that the effect may depend on both aggressiveness of the disease and the blood levels of lycopene, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids.   MP: Purpose The purpose of this Phase II randomized-controlled trial was to evaluate the safety and effect of administering several doses of lycopene to men with clinically localized prostate cancer, on intermediate endpoint biomarkers implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. Methods Forty-five eligible men with clinically localized prostate cancer were supplemented with 15, 30 or 45 mg of lycopene or no supplement from biopsy to prostatectomy. Compliance to study agent, toxicity, changes in plasma lycopene, serum steroid hormones, PSA and tissue Ki-67 were analyzed from baseline to completion of intervention. Results Forty-two of forty-five five subjects completed the intervention for approximately 30 days from the time of biopsy until prostatectomy. Plasma lycopene increased from baseline to post treatment in all treatment groups with greatest increase observed in the 45 mg lycopene-supplemented arm compared to the control arm without producing any toxicity. Overall, subjects with prostate cancer had lower baseline levels of plasma lycopene similar to those observed in previous studies in men with prostate cancer. Serum free testosterone decreased with 30 mg lycopene supplementation and total estradiol increased significantly with 30 mg and 45 mg supplementation from baseline to end of treatment, with no significant increases in serum PSA or tissue Ki-67. These changes were not significant compared to the control arm for this sample size and duration of intervention. Conclusions Although antioxidant properties of lycopene have been hypothesized to be primarily responsible for its beneficial effects, our study suggests that other mechanisms mediated by steroid hormones may also be involved.  MP: Epidemiologic studies suggest that diet can alter prostate cancer risk. This study aimed to establish the feasibility and acceptability of dietary modification in men at increased risk of prostate cancer. Men were invited with a PSA level of 2.0–2.95 ng/mL or 3.0–19.95 ng/mL with negative prostate biopsies. Randomization (3 × 3 factorial design) to daily green tea and lycopene: green tea drink (3 cups, unblinded) or capsules [blinded, 600 mg flavan-3-ol ()-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) or placebo] and lycopene-rich foods (unblinded) or capsules (blinded, 15 mg lycopene or placebo) for 6 months. Primary endpoints were randomization rates and intervention adherence (blinded assessment of metabolites) at 6 months with secondary endpoints of acceptability (from interviews), safety, weight, blood pressure, and PSA. A total of 133 of 469 (28.4%) men approached agreed to be randomized and 132 were followed-up (99.2%). Mean lycopene was 1.28 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.09–1.50, P = 0.003] times higher in the lycopene capsule group and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.21–1.66; P < 0.001) times higher in the lycopene-enriched diet group compared with placebo capsules. Median EGCG was 10.7 nmol/L (95% CI, 7.0–32.0) higher in in the active capsule group and 20.0 nmol/L (95% CI, 0.0–19.0) higher in the green tea drink group compared with placebo capsules (both P < 0.001). All interventions were acceptable and well tolerated although men preferred the capsules. Dietary prevention is acceptable to men at risk of prostate cancer. This intervention trial demonstrates that a chemoprevention clinical trial is feasible.  MP: This unblinded, randomized, Phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine whether lycopene supplementation lowered serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), surrogate endpoint for prostate cancer initiation or progression, in men with elevated prostate cancer risk. Afro-Caribbean men (n = 81) with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical foci or repeated non-cancerous biopsies, ascertained in a population-based screening program, were randomized to four months intervention with 30 mg/day lycopene (Lyc-O-Mato®) plus a multivitamin, or to multivitamin, only. Serum PSA and lycopene were compared at randomization, 1, and 4 mo using two-sided χ 2 and t-tests for independent samples. Treatment groups were similar at baseline. Serum lycopene levels approximately doubled in the lycopene intervention group. Serum PSA declined during the first month of treatment, but returned to randomization level by month 4. The PSA response was nearly identical in both treatment groups. No adverse effects attributed to lycopene supplementation were documented. We conclude that the PSA lowering response to antioxidant supplementation observed in previous 3-wk studies in men awaiting prostatectomy may have been a transient response, perhaps not specific to lycopene. Lowering of serum PSA may not be an appropriate endpoint for the long-term studies needed to evaluate lycopene supplementation for reducing prostate cancer initiation or progression.  MP: An inverse association has been observed between dietary intake of lycopene and the risk of prostate cancer. We investigated the effects of lycopene supplementation in patients with prostate cancer. Twenty-six men with newly diagnosed, clinically localized (14 T1 and 12 T2) prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive 15 mg of lycopene (n = 15) twice daily or no supplementation (n = 11) for 3 weeks before radical prostatectomy. Biomarkers of differentiation and apoptosis were assessed by Western blot analysis on benign and malignant parts of the prostate gland. Prostatectomy specimens were entirely embedded, step-sectioned, and evaluated for pathological stage, Gleason score, volume of cancer, and extent of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Plasma levels of lycopene, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein-3, and prostate-specific antigen were measured at baseline and after 3 weeks of supplementation or observation. Eleven (73%) subjects in the intervention group and two (18%) subjects in the control group had no involvement of surgical margins and/or extra-prostatic tissues with cancer (P = 0.02). Twelve (84%) subjects in the lycopene group and five (45%) subjects in the control group had tumors <4 ml in size (P = 0.22). Diffuse involvement of the prostate by high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was present in 10 (67%) subjects in the intervention group and in 11 (100%) subjects in the control group (P = 0.05). Plasma prostate-specific antigen levels decreased by 18% in the intervention group, whereas they increased by 14% in the control group (P = 0.25). Expression of connexin 43 in cancerous prostate tissue was 0.63 ± 0.19 absorbance in the lycopene group compared with 0.25 ± 0.08 in the control group (P = 0.13). Expression of bcl-2 and bax did not differ significantly between the two study groups. IGF-1 levels decreased in both groups (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The results suggest that lycopene supplementation may decrease the growth of prostate cancer. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn at this time because of the small sample size.  MP: Lycopene is a promising nutritional component for chemoprevention of prostate cancer (PCa). A possibly beneficial role of lycopene in patients diagnosed with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), who are at increased risk of developing PCa, has been suggested, although clinical data are lacking. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of lycopene supplementation in elderly men diagnosed with BPH. A total of 40 patients with histologically proven BPH free of PCa were randomized to receive either lycopene at a dose of 15 mg/d or placebo for 6 mo. The effects of the intervention on carotenoid status, clinical diagnostic markers of prostate proliferation, and symptoms of the disease were assessed. The primary endpoint of the study was the inhibition or reduction of increased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The 6-mo lycopene supplementation decreased PSA levels in men (P < 0.05), whereas there was no change in the placebo group. The plasma lycopene concentration increased in the group taking lycopene (P < 0.0001) but other plasma carotenoids were not affected. Whereas progression of prostate enlargement occurred in the placebo group as assessed by trans-rectal ultrasonography (P < 0.05) and digital rectal examination (P < 0.01), the prostate did not enlarge in the lycopene group. Symptoms of the disease, as assessed via the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire, were improved in both groups with a significantly greater effect in men taking lycopene supplements. In conclusion, lycopene inhibited progression of BPH."
"Objectives To explore the effects of different lengths of the three key steps (prebriefing, simulation, and debriefing) of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) on the knowledge and skills of undergraduate nursing students.  Design A systematic review and meta-analysis.  Data sources A systematic search was conducted for Chinese and English publications from the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and two Chinese databases (Wanfang and CNKI) up to November 24, 2021.  Review methods Two independent raters screened the retrieved studies and extracted data based on a coding protocol from the studies that met the inclusion criteria. Data were synthesized using meta-analytic procedures based on a random-effect model and computing effect sizes by standard mean differences (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results: Forty-four studies were included, and 23 studies were analyzed. High-fidelity simulation (HFS) with debriefing of 10 min or less (SMD = 1.18), simulation of 15–20 min (SMD = 1.43), and debriefing of 11–30 min (SMD = 1.19) showed larger effect sizes for knowledge, while HFS with debriefing of >10 min (SMD = 0.91), simulation of 15 min or less (SMD = 0.89), and over 30 min of debriefing cultivation (SMD = 0.84) showed larger effect sizes for skill.  Conclusions During the prebriefing, simulation, and debriefing, shorter sessions are more effective for improving knowledge in BSN students, whereas longer sessions are most effective for improving skills in BSN students. Nurse educators can schedule HFS to meet the expectations of learning outcomes based on the actual situation.","MP: Objectives: This study is involved in designing high-fidelity simulations reflecting the Korean nursing education environment. In addition, it evaluated the simulations by nursing students' learning outcomes and perceptions of the simulation design features. Design: A quantitative design was used in two separate phases. Settings and participants: For the first phase, five nursing experts participated in verifying the appropriateness of two simulation scenarios that reflected the intended learning objectives. For the second phase, 69 nursing students in the third year of a bachelor's degree at a nursing school participated in evaluating the simulations and were randomized according to their previous course grades. Methods: The first phase verified the two simulation scenarios using a questionnaire. The second phase evaluated students' perceptions of the simulation design, self-confidence, and critical thinking skills using a quasi-experimental post-test design. ANCOVA was used to compare the experimental and control groups, and correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the correlation among them. Results: We created 2 simulation scenarios to integrate cognitive and psychomotor skills according to the learning objectives and clinical environment in Korea. The experimental group had significantly higher scores on self-confidence in the first scenario. The positive correlations between perceptions of the simulation design features, self-confidence, and critical thinking skill scores were statistically significant. Conclusions: Students with a more positive perception of the design features of the simulations had better learning outcomes. Based on this result, simulations need to be designed and implemented with more differentiation in order to be perceived more appropriately by students.  MP: Background: The purpose of this quasi-experimental research study was to examine the effect of high-fidelity basic life support (BLS) simulation on knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy of Jordanian nursing students. Method: The experimental group (n = 52) received traditional teaching of BLS (3-hour PowerPoint presentation and demonstration on static manikin in groups of 6 to 7 students) and high-fidelity BLS simulation, while the control group (n = 58) received only traditional teaching of BLS (3-hour PowerPoint presentation and demonstration on static manikin in groups of 6 to 7 students). Results: Neither knowledge acquisition nor knowledge retention showed any significant differences between the groups; however, self-efficacy showed significant differences. Conclusions: Students trained with high-fidelity simulation achieved higher scores in acquired and retained BLS knowledge and higher self-efficacy perception, indicating the value of simulation in improving knowledge and self-efficacy in nursing students. Nursing students must be educated with the most realistic technologies available to improve patients' safety.  MP: Background There is a gap in the literature regarding learning outcomes linked to the use of high-fidelity simulators compared to that of traditional teaching methods.  Aim To examine the effect of using high-fidelity simulators on knowledge and skills acquisition and retention with university students.  Methods A randomized two-arm trial using two different educational approaches on 90 nursing students assigned randomly to two groups was used at two points of time.  Findings The results showed significant differences in favor of the participants in the high-fidelity simulator group on both the acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills over time. However, a significant loss of cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge and skills occurred at 3 months after training in both groups.  Conclusions The findings of this study may assist educators in integrating high-fidelity simulators in education and training. In addition, the findings may help nursing educators to arrange additional cardiopulmonary resuscitation training sessions in order to improve cardiac arrested patients’ outcomes.     MP: Background The use of simulation to reproduce the experience of health care settings and its use as a strategy in the teaching of nurses has grown at an unprecedented rate. There is little scientific evidence to examine the differences in satisfaction and gains perceived by the students with the use of medium and high fidelity. Objectives To analyse and benchmark gains and satisfaction perceived by nursing students, according to their participation in medium- and high-fidelity simulated practice. Design Randomized control trial post-test only design with control group. Setting and Participants Students of the 4th year of the Bachelor's Degree in Nursing who performed medium and high-fidelity simulated practice in a Simulation Centre environment. Methods A satisfaction scale and a scale of perceived gains from the simulation were applied to the students who underwent simulated practice in a medium-fidelity environment (control group) and high-fidelity environment (experimental group). Statistical analysis was performed and a significance level of p < 0.05 was established. Results Of the 85 students who participated in the study, the majority were female (92.94%), with an average age of 21.89 years (SD = 2.81 years). Satisfaction is statistically significant in the realism dimension and overall satisfaction. In the gains perceived with the simulation there is a statistically significant difference in the dimension recognition/decision. Conclusion Students are very satisfied with the realism of high-fidelity simulated practice and consider that this helps them more with recognition and decision compared with the medium-fidelity simulation.  MP: Use of a human patient simulator (HPS) as a tool for experiential learning provides a mechanism by which students can participate in clinical decision making, practice skills, and observe outcomes from clinical decisions. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two instructional methods to teach specific nursing education content, acute myocardial infarction, on junior-level nursing students' cognitive skills and confidence. The instructional methods included an interactive approach using the HPS method, compared with traditional classroom lecture. Results of this study suggest that use of a teaching strategy involving the HPS method made a positive difference in the nursing students' ability to answer questions on a test of cognitive skills. Confidence levels were not found to be significantly enhanced by use of the HPS method.  MP: Visible-light-driven In-rich AgInS2 nanoplates and nanotubes were successfully prepared by a convenient co-precipitation strategy at low temperature. The effect of different In/Ag molar ratio in the raw materials on the physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of AgInS2 was investigated. The In/Ag molar ratio has an obvious effect on the morphology of AgInS2, and the physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of AgInS2 are also dependent on the In/Ag molar ratio. When the molar ratio of In/Ag is 9, the photoluminescence intensity of AgInS2 reaches a minimum value, while its photocurrent density is maximum (0.011 mA/cm2), indicating the most efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. The AgInS2 with the In/Ag molar ratio of 9 exhibits the highest visible-light photocatalytic activities with almost complete degradation of 2-nitrophenol, which is attributed to the narrowest band gap and the most efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. Moreover, In-rich AgInS2 exhibits excellent regeneration ability.   MP: Assisting patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a crucial role for nurses, and as future nurses, students should demonstrate sound clinical judgment. Well-structured, high-quality simulations are useful alternatives to prepare students for clinical practice. However, nursing simulation scenarios focused on enhancing clinical judgment in managing upper gastrointestinal bleeding are limited. This study aims to develop, apply, and evaluate an effective nursing simulation scenario for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding based on Tanner's clinical judgment model using a mixed methods study design. A high-fidelity patient simulation was conducted among 80 undergraduate nursing students divided into a simulated control group (n = 39) and an experimental group (n = 41). Subsequent student performance evaluations used questionnaires and video recordings. After scenario simulations, the students showed a statistically significant increase in theoretical knowledge (p = 0.001) and clinical performance skills (p < 0.001), but there was no significant increase in self-confidence (p = 0.291). According to the video analysis, the “noticing” clinical judgment phase was the most frequently observed phase, while “reflection” was the least frequently observed phase. Additionally, “education” was the most frequently observed nursing domain, and “anxiety” was the least frequently observed domain. Although further simulation repetitions are required to reinforce students' self-confidence when caring for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the scenario was deemed effective. Moreover, emphasis should be placed on developing various scenarios to strengthen students' clinical judgment skills, especially “reflecting” and “emotional care.   MP: With the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease, virtual reality simulation (vSim) has emerged as a simulation educational method. The purpose of this study is to examine the learning effects of vSim by comparing three different educational modalities of nursing care for children with asthma. A quasi-experimental design with three different teaching methods, vSim, high-fidelity simulation (HFS), and vSim with HFS, were used in the study. The group using vSim with HFS showed the highest scores in knowledge, confidence in practice, and performance compared to groups using vSim or HFS alone. Simulation practice using vSim combined with HFS could be an effective educational method for nursing students.  MP: Aim: This paper describes a study that measured and compared knowledge acquisition in nursing students exposed to medium or high fidelity human patient simulation manikins. Background: In Australia and internationally the use of simulated learning environments has escalated. Simulation requires a significant investment of time and money and in a period of economic rationalisation this investment must be justified. Assessment of knowledge acquisition with multiple choice questions is the most common approach used to determine the effectiveness of simulation experiences. Method: This study was conducted in an Australian school of nursing; 84 third year nursing students participated. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of the level of manikin fidelity on knowledge acquisition. Data were collected at three points in time: prior to the simulation, immediately following and two weeks later. Results: Differences in mean scores between the control (medium fidelity) and experimental (high fidelity) groups for Tests 1, 2 and 3 were calculated using independent t tests and were not statistically significant. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to determine whether changes in knowledge scores occurred over time and, while an improvement in scores was observed, it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The results of this study raise questions about the value of investing in expensive simulation modalities when the increased costs associated with high fidelity manikins may not be justified by a concomitant increase learning outcomes. This study also suggests that multiple choice questions may not be the most appropriate measure of simulation effectiveness.  MP: As a key cellular transcription factor that plays a central role in cellular responses to a broad range of stress factors, p53 has generally been considered as a host cell restriction factor for various viral infections. However, the defined roles of p53 in pseudorabies virus (PRV) replication, pathogenesis, and host responses remain unclear. In the present study, we initially constructed a p53 overexpressing a porcine kidney epithelial cell line (PK-15) to detect the effect of p53 on PRV replication in vitro. The results show that viral glycoprotein B (gB) gene copies and the titers of virus were significantly higher in p53 overexpressing PK-15 cells than in PK-15 and p53 inhibitor treated p53 overexpressing PK-15 cells. A similar result was also found in the p53 inhibitor PFT-α-treated PK-15 cells. We then examined the effects of p53 on PRV infection in vivo by using p53-knockout (p53 -/- ) mice. The results show that p53 knockout not only led to significantly reduced rates of mortality but also to reduced viral replication and development of viral encephalitis in the brains of mice following intracranial inoculation. Furthermore, we examined the effect of p53 knockout on the expression of the reported host cell regulators of PRV replication in the brains of mice by using RNA sequencing. The results show that p53 knockout downregulated the interferon (IFN) regulator genes, chemokine genes, and antiviral genes after PRV infection. This finding suggests that p53 positively regulates viral replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These findings offer novel targets of intrinsic host cell immunity for PRV infection.  MP: Background: The conventional superposition methods use an ordinary least squares (LS) fit for structural comparison of two different conformations of the same protein. The main problem of the LS fit that it is sensitive to outliers, i.e. large displacements of the original structures superimposed. Results: To overcome this problem, we present a new algorithm to overlap two protein conformations by their atomic coordinates using a robust statistics technique: least median of squares (LMS). In order to effectively approximate the LMS optimization, the forward search technique is utilized. Our algorithm can automatically detect and superimpose the rigid core regions of two conformations with small or large displacements. In contrast, most existing superposition techniques strongly depend on the initial LS estimating for the entire atom sets of proteins. They may fail on structural superposition of two conformations with large displacements. The presented LMS fit can be considered as an alternative and complementary tool for structural superposition. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is robust and does not require any prior knowledge of the flexible regions. Furthermore, we show that the LMS fit can be extended to multiple level superposition between two conformations with several rigid domains. Our fit tool has produced successful superpositions when applied to proteins for which two conformations are known. The binary executable program for Windows platform, tested examples, and database are available from https://engineering.purdue.edu/PRECISE/LMSfit.  MP: Currently, the application of phase-to-phase spacers can effectively prevent and control line faults caused by conductor galloping and is one of the most effective methods to prevent galloping of transmission lines. The installation layout scheme of phase-to-phase spacers directly affects the anti-galloping effect. Moreover, the common empirical formula can not accurately assess the anti-galloping effect of phase-to-phase spacers. In this paper, the nonlinear finite element method is employed to establish an accurate analysis model of phase-to-phase spacers for conductors. And the anti-galloping effects of phase-to-phase spacers installed in different ways are analyzed, with the aim of providing an effective method for the installation of phase-to-phase spacers used in practical transmission lines.  MP: This paper has developed a pragmatic technique to efficiently and accurately determine the Klinkenberg permeability for tight formations with different pore-throat structures. Firstly, the authors use steady-state experiments to measure the Klinkenberg permeability of 56 tight core samples under different mean pore pressures and confining pressures. Secondly, pressure-controlled mercury injection (PMI) experiments and thin-section analyses are conducted to differentiate pore-throat structures. After considering capillary pressure curve, pore types, throat size, particle composition, and grain size, the pore-throat structure in the target tight formation was classified into three types: a good sorting and micro-fine throat (GSMFT) type, a moderate sorting and micro-fine throat (MSMFT) type, and a bad sorting and micro throat (BSMT) type. This study found that a linear relationship exists between the Klinkenberg permeability and measured gas permeability for all three types of pore-throat structures. Subsequently, three empirical equations are proposed, based on 50 core samples of data, to estimate the Klinkenberg permeability by using the measured gas permeability and mean pore pressure for each type of pore-throat structure. In addition, the proposed empirical equations can generate accurate estimates of the Klinkenberg permeability with a relative error of less than 5% in comparison to its measured value. The application of the proposed empirical equations to the remaining six core samples has demonstrated that it is necessary to use an appropriate equation to determine the Klinkenberg permeability of a specific type of pore-throat structure. Consequently, the newly developed technique is proven to be qualified for accurately determining the Klinkenberg permeability of tight formations in a timely manner.  MP: Background  Improving nursing students' knowledge and clinical judgment related to mechanical ventilation (MV) is paramount, considering the heightened need for MV due to the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. High-fidelity simulation (HFS) provides students with real-life clinical experiences that they would rarely confront in clinical training, especially complex case scenarios (such as a patient needing MV).  Purpose  This study assessed students' clinical knowledge and judgment after including HFS involving MV in an undergraduate nursing program.  Methods  This was a quasi-experimental design with a convenience sample of 151 nursing students using the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric.  Results  There were significant differences between the intervention and control groups in knowledge (t = 20.42; P = .001) and total clinical judgment scores (t = 19.55; P < .001) post-HFS.  Conclusions  Including a complex case study using MV and HFS significantly improved students' clinical decision-making, clinical knowledge, and self-confidence and enhanced their critical thinking, noticing, interpreting, reflecting, and responding capabilities.  MP: BACKGROUND: High-fidelity simulation (HFS) as a teaching-learning method has increased, especially in medical programs. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of using HFS on the satisfaction, self-confidence, self-efficacy, and knowledge of undergraduate students in oncology care. METHODS: A pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design was utilized. Random sampling technique was used to recruit the participants. The scenarios including septic shock and infusion reaction were implemented. The training program including lectures and the simulation was run in a high fidelity simulation lab. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (t=-5.95, p= 0.001) between the experimental group (M= 13.95, S D= 3.35) and the control group (M= 6.25, SD= 2.65) regarding knowledge, confidence (t=-22.75, p= 0.001) between the experimental group (M= 61.25, SD= 12.10) and the control group (M= 38.50, SD= 6.20), satisfaction level t=-18.25, p= 0.001; experimental group-M= 42.25, SD= 4.25; and control group-M= 28.50, SD= 3.15), and there was a significant difference between the experimental group (M= 35.50, SD= 3.25) and control group (M= 24.25, SD= 2.85) regarding self-efficacy (t=-13.25, p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High-fidelity simulation in nursing increased student knowledge, self-confidence, satisfaction, and self-efficacy in managing septic shock and infusion reaction as common oncology emergencies.  MP: Due to the increasing focus on simulation used in nursing education, there is a need to examine how the scenarios and different simulation methods used are perceived by students. The aim of this study was to examine nursing students' perceptions of scenarios played out in different simulation methods, and whether their educational level influenced their perception. The study had a quantitative, evaluative and comparative design. The sample consisted of baccalaureate nursing students (n=86) within various educational levels. The students were randomly divided into groups. They solved a patient case adapted to their educational level by using a high-fidelity patient simulator, a static mannequin or a paper/pencil case study. Data were collected by three instruments developed by the National League for Nursing. The results showed that the nursing students reported satisfaction with the implementation of the scenarios regardless of the simulation methods used. The findings indicated that the students who used the paper/pencil case study were the most satisfied. Moreover, educational level did not seem to influence their perceptions. Conclusions: Independent of educational level, the findings indicated that simulation with various degrees of fidelity could be used in nursing education. There is a need for further research to examine more closely the rationale behind the students' perception of the simulation methods.

MP: Objective To explore the effect of application of SimMan human body simulator in nursing teaching experiments on emergency and critical care. Methods Forty undergraduate nursing students in 2012 were assigned as the experiment group, where nursing teaching experiments on emergency and critical care were conducted based on SimMan human body simulator. Forty undergraduate nursing students in 2011 were assigned as the control group, where the traditional teaching method was employed. The emergency ability of the nursing students in the two groups was evaluated, and the nursing students′ attitudes towards two teaching methods were investigated. Results The emergency ability was higher in the experiment group than that of the control group (P<0.05). The satisfaction level with teaching method in the experiment group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). Conclusions SimMan human body simulator is effective in improving emergency ability of nursing students in nursing teaching experiments of emergency and critical care. It is worth popularizing and applying.  MP: "
"Although some meta-analyses have investigated the effect of Entrepreneurship Education (EE), they mixed studies with high and low methodological quality. Thus, their results might overestimate the impact. This paper aims to examine the efficacy of the EE in student samples, attending to studies with a pre-posttest design and a control group.  The results showed small effect sizes for EE in increasing Entrepreneurship Intention (EI) and Self-efficacy. Moreover, meta-regression confirmed that the duration of intervention programs predicted larger effect sizes for the EI. Finally, the practical implications of other potential moderator variables are discussed.","MP: The research on entrepreneurship education-entrepreneurial intentions has yielded mixed results. We meta-analyzed 73 studies with a total sample size of 37,285 individuals and found a significant but a small correlation between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intentions ( r ^ = 1 4 3 ). This correlation is also greater than that of business education and entrepreneurial intentions. However, after controlling for pre-education entrepreneurial intentions, the relationship between entrepreneurship education and post-education entrepreneurial intentions was not significant. We also analyzed moderators, such as the attributes of entrepreneurship education, students' differences, and cultural values. Our results have implications for entrepreneurship education scholars, program evaluators, and policy makers.  MP: This study systematically reviewed 21 quantitative and qualitative articles on the effect of entrepreneurship education in schools. We reviewed short-term effects, focusing on the effect of entrepreneurship education on children and adolescents during or right after exposure to it, as well as long-term effects focusing on the effect in later years. We found the impact of entrepreneurship education in schools to be gender and age sensitive: for female and older pupils, entrepreneurship education has a negative effect on entrepreneurship outcomes compared to male and younger pupils. We further found that a positive effect of entrepreneurship education is generally stronger if the programme under investigation is less achievement oriented. We not only contributed to structuring currently fragmented impact research, but we also identified directions for future research and encouraged those designing entrepreneurship education programmes in schools to take into account the heterogeneity of participants.  MP: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between general education, specific forms of entrepreneurial education and a range of entrepreneurial activities.  Design/methodology/approach The relationships were investigated through an analysis of peer‐reviewed research published in a wide range of journals and proceedings between 1995 and 2006.  Findings Findings suggest strong evidence supporting the relationship between levels of general education and several entrepreneurial success measures. The findings are less clear in regards to the link between general education and the choice to become an entrepreneur. The findings linking specific programs of entrepreneurship education to entrepreneurship, although ambiguous, suggest a positive link between such education and both the choice to become an entrepreneur and subsequent entrepreneurial success.  Research limitations/implications The review of research suggests four implications for existing research: a need for increased research outside the USA; an understanding that inconsistencies in findings may be to a great extent temporal artifacts; a need for increased research focused on innovation; and an acknowledgement that “venture exit” as an outcome measure has received limited attention.  Practical implications Given the significant investments by both private organizations and governments aimed at increasing rates of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success through education, it is important to understand that while the evidence supporting the links between education and entrepreneurial outcomes is promising it is not yet definitive.  Originality/value In addition to providing a review of existing research this paper suggests an integrative framework for future research.  MP: True experimental design and quasi-experimental design are considered to be rigorous research designs appropriate for assessing the impact of pedagogical interventions. This study explores the extent and application of experimental design in impact research on entrepreneurship education (EE) based on a systematic literature review. The findings reveal a substantial lack of methodologically rigorous studies on EE impact, which has severe implications for the accumulated knowledge on the subject. Furthermore, the article summarizes the findings from the body of experimental impact studies with a strong research design and concludes by indicating fruitful avenues for future research.   MP: The majority of studies that analyze the impact of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial attitudes, intentions, and venture activities report positive influences. However, several scholars have recently cast doubts about research methods and the generalizability of entrepreneurship education impact studies. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review of the methods used in entrepreneurship education impact studies. Our results uncover significant methodological deficiencies and question the overwhelmingly positive impact of entrepreneurship education. Based on this evidence, we propose a series of recommendations to improve the reliability and validity of entrepreneurship education impact studies and we outline promising topics which are currently under-researched.  MP: Effective human capital formation through the medium of entrepreneurship education and training (EET) is of increasing concern for governments, as EET is growing rapidly across the world. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consistent evidence showing that EET helps to create more or better entrepreneurs. We undertake the first quantitative review of the literature and, in the context of human capital theory, find that there is indeed support for the value of EET. Based on 42 independent samples (N=16,657), we find a significant relationship between EET and entrepreneurship-related human capital assets (rw=217) and entrepreneurship outcomes (rw=159). The relationship between EET and entrepreneurship outcomes is stronger for academic-focused EET interventions (rw=238) than for training-focused EET interventions (rw=151). We find evidence of heterogeneity in many of our correlations, and recommend that future studies examine potential moderators to more clearly delineate EET effect sizes. We also find a number of methodological weaknesses among the studies analyzed and that those studies with lower methodological rigor are overstating the effect of EET. Recommendations to improve the quality of future work in the field are provided.  MP: Purpose: This paper aims to take stock of existing publications devoted to entrepreneurship education and assess the alignment existing between its generic objectives, target audience, teaching methods and impact indicators. Design/methodology/approach: A semi-systematic literature review is applied; using six thematically separated excel data collection spreadsheets. Datasheets were used in order to reduce the author's bias. A total of 108 articles are reviewed in stages and by categorizing in terms of educational objectives, target audiences, community outreach activities, applied teaching methods and impact indicators. Findings: Scholars in this field of study, though differing in a number of definitive issues, are converging towards a single framework of entrepreneurship education. There is a shift from a start-up view to an attitude-changing perspective of entrepreneurship education. However, with a diversity of target groups, there is still a non-alignment between what educators and other stakeholders wish to achieve in educating for entrepreneurship with the applied pedagogical approaches, and success indicators. Research limitations/implications: The work has some limitations involved with literature reviews. The main noticeable limitation is the inclusion of both empirical and theoretical literature; it would be more appropriate to use a meta-analysis approach. Practical implications: Entrepreneurship education is reviewed in its totality. This is beneficial to educators and policy-makers that are involved in setting or facilitating entrepreneurship educational programmes. The work will, specifically, help to understand problems related to non-alignment in setting entrepreneurship educational programmes; a common pitfall for most of education designers. Originality/value: The novelty of the work is in the use of data collection sheets. This has minimized the author's own bias, and brought some logical quantification into drawing meanings and conclusions from the existing literature in entrepreneurship education.  MP: Using a teaching model framework, we systematically review empirical evidence on the impact of entrepreneurship education (EE) in higher education on a range of entrepreneurial outcomes, analyzing 159 published articles from 2004 to 2016. The teaching model framework allows us for the first time to start rigorously examining relationships between pedagogical methods and specific outcomes. Reconfirming past reviews and meta-Analyses, we find that EE impact research still predominantly focuses on short-Term and subjective outcome measures and tends to severely underdescribe the actual pedagogies being tested. Moreover, we use our review to provide an up-To-date and empirically rooted call for less obvious, yet greatly promising, new or underemphasized directions for future research on the impact of university-based entrepreneurship education. This includes, for example, the use of novel impact indicators related to emotion and mind-set, focus on the impact indicators related to the intention-To-behavior transition, and exploring the reasons for some contradictory findings in impact studies including person-, context-, and pedagogical model-specific moderators.  MP: Does entrepreneurship education (E-ed) really work to create business enterprise? We conducted a comprehensive review and methodological critique of the empirical research on the outcomes of university-based E-ed. We identified every empirical study conducted over the past decade, and found 12 that minimally met our methodologically ""robust"" (Storey Steps 4-6) standard. Our systematic critique of the studies' research methods found a variety of methodological weaknesses, undermining confidence in the belief that E-ed can produce entrepreneurship. The implications for both practice and policy are discussed, and recommendations are made for conducting future E-ed outcome research."
"Background Chronic inflammation is one of the most important factors involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVDs). Accumulating evidence has described the effect of resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, on biomarkers of inflammation among patients with CVDs; however, findings are controversial. Here we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of resveratrol supplements on TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP levels in CVDs patients.  Methods Online research was conducted in the following database: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science databases, and Scopus. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplements on inflammatory biomarkers among patients with CVDs. The meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) V3 software.  Results Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the current meta-analysis. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol significantly decreases serum levels of CRP (MD = −0.63, 95 % CI: −0.1.13, −0.12; p = 0.01), and TNF-α (MD = −0.55, 95 % CI: −1.04, −0.06; p = 0.02), however, resveratrol had not significant effect on serum concentration of IL-6 (MD = −0.12, 95 % CI: −0.52, 0.27; p = 0.53), in patients with CVDs.  Conclusion Our results suggest that resveratrol can be used as a potential treatment in patients with CVD by reducing inflammatory conditions.","MP: This study was performed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on metabolic status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 56 patients having T2DM and CHD. The patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 500 mg resveratrol per day (n = 28) or placebo (n = 28) for 4 weeks. Resveratrol reduced fasting glucose (β −10.04 mg dL−1; 95% CI, −18.23, −1.86; P = 0.01), insulin (β −1.09 μIU mL−1; 95% CI, −1.93, −0.24; P = 0.01) and insulin resistance (β −0.48; 95% CI, −0.76, −0.21; P = 0.001) and significantly increased insulin sensitivity (β 0.006; 95% CI, 0.001, 0.01; P = 0.02) when compared with the placebo. Resveratrol also significantly increased HDL-cholesterol levels (β 3.38 mg dL−1; 95% CI, 1.72, 5.05; P < 0.001) and significantly decreased the total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio (β −0.36; 95% CI, −0.59, −0.13; P = 0.002) when compared with the placebo. Additionally, resveratrol caused a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (β 58.88 mmol L−1; 95% CI, 17.33, 100.44; P = 0.006) and a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (β −0.21 μmol L−1; 95% CI, −0.41, −0.005; P = 0.04) when compared with the placebo. Resveratrol upregulated PPAR-γ (P = 0.01) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) (P = 0.01) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T2DM patients with CHD. Resveratrol supplementation did not have any effect on inflammatory markers. Four-week supplementation of resveratrol in patients with T2DM and CHD had beneficial effects on glycemic control, HDL-cholesterol levels, the total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, TAC and MDA levels. Resveratrol also upregulated PPAR-γ and SIRT1 in the PBMCs of T2DM patients with CHD.  MP: Objective: to study the effect of polyphenolic antioxidants, resveratrol and quercetin, on endothelial degeneration factors in cad patients. Materials and Methods: the study involved 93 patients with coronary artery disease: stable angina pectoris, fc ii. the cytofluorometric technique was applied to define the level of circulating endothelial microparticles (emP) cd32+cd40+ in peripheral blood in order to identify ed. the content of tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α), fibrinogen, hemocoagulation and lipid profile parameters were being determined in the blood, as well. Patients were divided into 3 groups. basic therapy (β-blockers, statins, aspirin) was prescribed to 33 persons of the comparison group, patients of the study group 1 (30 persons) additionally received resveratrol at a dose of 100 mg daily, patients of the study group 2 (30 persons) got quercetin at a dose of 3 g per day. in 2 months, the second examination of the patients was performed in the amount indicated. Results: under the influence of resveratrol a significant reduction of the level of tnf-α and the number of emP in peripheral blood was shown, in contrast to the results of other study groups. all groups showed a decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, statistical differences between data of groups were not found. indicators of coagulogramma in all study groups did not change significantly, however, there was a statistically significant reduction of fibrinogen in the blood. Conclusions: resveratrol, unlike quercetin, has a positive effect on the endothelial function and systemic inflammation, which may be the result of its influence on intracellular molecular cascades associated with the nuclear transcription factor of nf-kb.  MP: Purpose The grape and wine polyphenol resveratrol exerts cardiovascular benefits but evidence from randomized human clinical trials is very limited. We investigated dose-depending effects of a resveratrol-containing grape supplement on stable patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated according to currently accepted guidelines for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.  Methods In a triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, one-year follow-up, 3-arm pilot clinical trial, 75 stable-CAD patients received 350 mg/day of placebo, resveratrol-containing grape extract (grape phenolics plus 8 mg resveratrol) or conventional grape extract lacking resveratrol during 6 months, and a double dose for the following 6 months. Changes in circulating inflammatory and fibrinolytic biomarkers were analyzed. Moreover, the transcriptional profiling of inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was explored using microarrays and functional gene expression analysis.  Results After 1 year, in contrast to the placebo and conventional grape extract groups, the resveratrol-containing grape extract group showed an increase of the anti-inflammatory serum adiponectin (9.6 %, p = 0.01) and a decrease of the thrombogenic plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (−18.6 %, p = 0.05). In addition, 6 key inflammation-related transcription factors were predicted to be significantly activated or inhibited, with 27 extracellular-space acting genes involved in inflammation, cell migration and T-cell interaction signals presenting downregulation (p < 0.05) in PBMCs. No adverse effects were detected in relation to the study products.  Conclusions Chronic daily consumption of a resveratrol-containing grape nutraceutical could exert cardiovascular benefits in stable-CAD patients treated according to current evidence-based standards, by increasing serum adiponectin, preventing PAI-1 increase and inhibiting atherothrombotic signals in PBMCs.  MP: Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of short-term (60-d) oral supplementation with calcium fructoborate, resveratrol, and their combination on the clinical and biological statuses of subjects with stable angina pectoris. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled, parallel clinical trial was conducted in three groups of subjects. Of the total number of subjects included in study (n = 166), 87 completed the 60-d test treatment study period and 29 followed in parallel their usual medical care and treatment. The primary outcomes were inflammation biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), left ventricular function markers (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide), and lipid markers (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerols). Quality of life was assessed by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class and the number of angina attacks per week. Results: There was a significant decrease of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in all groups at the 30-d and 60-d visits. This decrease was greater (39.7% at 60 d) for group 3 (calcium fructoborate), followed by group 2 (resveratrol plus calcium fructoborate, 30.3% at 60 d). The N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide was significantly lowered by resveratrol (group 1, 59.7% at 60 d) and by calcium fructoborate (group 3, 52.6% at 60 d). However, their combination (group 2) was the most effective and induced a decrease of 65.5%. Lipid markers showed slight changes from baseline in all groups. The improvement in the quality of life was best observed for subjects who received the resveratrol and calcium fructoborate mixture (group 2). Conclusion: The results indicate that the combination of resveratrol and calcium fructoborate has beneficial effects in patients with angina   MP: The search for complementary treatments in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a high-priority challenge. Grape and wine polyphenol resveratrol confers CV benefits, in part by exerting anti-inflammatory effects. However, the evidence in human long-term clinical trials has yet to be established. We aimed to investigate the effects of a dietary resveratrol-rich grape supplement on the inflammatory and fibrinolytic status of subjects at high risk of CVD and treated according to current guidelines for primary prevention of CVD. Seventy-five patients undergoing primary prevention of CVD participated in this triple-blinded, randomized, parallel, dose-response, placebo-controlled, 1-year follow-up trial. Patients, allocated in 3 groups, consumed placebo (maltodextrin), a resveratrol-rich grape supplement (resveratrol 8 mg), or a conventional grape supplement lacking resveratrol, for the first 6 months and a double dose for the next 6 months. In contrast to placebo and conventional grape supplement, the resveratrol-rich grape supplement significantly decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-26%, p = 0.03), tumor necrosis factor-α (-19.8%, p = 0.01), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (-16.8%, p = 0.03), and interleukin-6/interleukin-10 ratio (-24%, p = 0.04) and increased anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (19.8%, p = 0.00). Adiponectin (6.5%, p = 0.07) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (-5.7%, p = 0.06) tended to increase and decrease, respectively. No adverse effects were observed in any patient. In conclusion, 1-year consumption of a resveratrol-rich grape supplement improved the inflammatory and fibrinolytic status in patients who were on statins for primary prevention of CVD and at high CVD risk (i.e., with diabetes or hypercholesterolemia plus <1 other CV risk factor). Our results show for the first time that a dietary intervention with grape resveratrol could complement the gold standard therapy in the primary prevention of CVD.  MP: Several beneficial effects of resveratrol (RES), a natural antioxidant present in red wine have already been described. The aim of our study was to investigate if RES had a clinically measurable cardioprotective effect in patients after myocardial infarction. In this double-blind, placebo controlled trial 40 post-infarction Caucasian patients were randomized into two groups. One group received 10 mg RES capsule daily for 3 months. Systolic and diastolic left ventricular function, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), several laboratory and hemorheological parameters were measured before and after the treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction showed an increasing tendency (ns) by RES treatment. However, left ventricular diastolic function was improved significantly (p < 0.01) by RES. A significant improvement in endothelial function measured by FMD was also observed (p < 0.05). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the RES treated group. Red blood cell deformability decreased and platelet aggregation increased significantly in the placebo group (p < 0.05), while resveratrol treatment has prevented these unfavourable changes. Concerning other measured parameters no significant changes were observed neither in placebo nor in RES group. Our results show that resveratrol improved left ventricle diastolic function, endothelial function, lowered LDL-cholesterol level and protected against unfavourable hemorheological changes measured in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

"Background The majority of patients with epilepsy in resource-poor countries never receive proper treatment, and those who are started on anti-seizure medications quickly discontinue them. Medication noncompliance is extremely common, with estimates ranging from 26 to 79 percent. Non-adherence to antiseizure medications is associated with poor seizure control, increased morbidity, increased hospitalization time, poor quality of life, increased health care costs, and increased mortality in adults.  Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 guideline was used for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The databases Pub Med, Cochrane Library, Scopus Online, and Google Scholar were all searched. STATA™ version 11 software was used for the meta-analysis. The I2 test and Egger's tests were used to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. The random-effects method was used to estimate the pooled adherence level with a 95 percent confidence interval.  Results This meta-analysis included twelve Ethiopian studies involving a total of 3416 epileptic patients. The national pooled prevalence of antiseizure medication non-adherence was 41.96%. Patients who paid for their medications, took them for more than a year, had co-morbidity, and felt stigmatized were more likely to be non-adherent than their counterparts.  Conclusion According to this systematic review and meta-analysis, more than two out of every five epileptic patients did not take their antiseizure medications as prescribed. Clinicians must educate epileptic patients about the importance of medication adherence.","MP: An epileptic seizure is a clinical event presumed to result from an abnormal and excessive neuronal discharge. The clinical symptoms are paroxysmal and may include impaired consciousness and motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic events perceived by the subject or an observer. Epilepsy occurs when 2 or more epileptic seizures occur unprovoked by any immediately identifiable cause. And in the majority of patients with epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs effectively control their illness. However, more than 30% of people with epilepsy do not attain full seizure control, even with the best available treatment regimen. The aim of this study is to assess self-reported adherence in adult patients with epilepsy and to identify potential barriers for nonadherence to antiepileptic drug treatment in Dessie Referral Hospital. A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted using structured questionnaires including Morisky medication adherence scale and analysis was conducted descriptively using SPSS version 20. The level of nonadherence to antiepileptic medication regimens was 34.1%. The major reason for missing medication was forgetfulness 53.5%. And the most common side effect was sedation 56.2%. Conclusion. Majority of epileptic patients in Dessie Referral Hospital was adherent to their AEDs treatment and among the determinants of adherence assessed the level of education and the side effect of drugs showed statistical significance.   MP: Medication non-adherence to antiepileptic medications is detrimental to the perceived outcome of treatment. Non-adherence to medication regimen accounts for substantial worsening of disease, death and increased health care costs. In this study, we aimed to determine adherence rate to antiepileptic medications and identify the potential risk factors associated with non-adherence in Jimma University Specialized Hospital/JUSH. A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted on 265 patients using patients self report and pharmacy refill record. The self report involved the structured patient interview after verbal informed consent was obtained. Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Chi-square test was used to observe the association of variables with adherence. The adherence rate of patients (n= 265) to antiepileptic drugs/AED was found to be 63.2% based on their refill records, compliant fill rate. On the basis of patient’s self report for their pattern of drug use, 155 (58.5%) patients reported that they had never missed (neither daily dose nor time of taking), 78 (29.4%) missed daily dose some times, 12 (4.5%) missed only time of taking, and 7.5%(n= 20) missed both time of taking and daily dose sometimes. The most common reasons for missing dose were forgetfulness (31.8%) followed by being busy (20.9%). Sedation (39.4%) was the commonest side effect faced by the patient. The rate of adherence absorbed in this study was low. Pill burden, co-morbid conditions and appointment missing were found to affect adherence. The high rate of non-adherence, in this study calls for further research and due consideration in planning appropriate strategies to improve the existing conditions  MP: Introduction. Antiepileptic drugs are effective in the treatment of epilepsy to the extent that about 70% of people with epilepsy can be seizure-free, but poor adherence to medication is major problem to sustained remission and functional restoration. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of antiepileptic drug nonadherence. Methods. Cross-sectional study was conducted on 450 individuals who were selected by systematic random sampling method. Antiepileptic drug nonadherence was measured by Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and logistic regression was used to look for significant associations. Result. The prevalence of AEDs nonadherence was 37.8%. Being on treatment for 6 years and above [AOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.88, 6.40], payment for AEDs [AOR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.73, 4.42], lack of health information [AOR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.41,3.43], poor social support [AOR = 1.88, 95%, CI: 1.01, 3.50], perceived stigma [AOR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.45, 3.56], and experience side effect [AOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.72] were significantly associated with antiepileptic drug nonadherence. Conclusion. More than one-third of people with epilepsy were not compliant with their AEDs. Giving health information about epilepsy and its management and consequent reduction in stigma will help for medication adherence.  MP: Background Non adherence of epileptic patients to antiepileptic medication often leads to an increased risk of seizures and worsening of disease, death and increased health care costs.  Objective to assess adherence to treatment and factors affecting adherence of epileptic patients at Yirgalem General Hospital, Southern Ethiopia.  Methods and Materials We conducted a cross-sectional study on epileptic patients from February 9 to 22, 2015. Data were collected from patients ≥18 years old. Adherence was measured using the eight-item Morisky’s medication adherence scale. All consecutive patients coming to epilepsy clinic during the study period were interviewed until the calculated sample size (210) was obtained. We collected patient demographics, perception about epilepsy and adherence to medication(s). We used chi-square tests and a binary logistic regression model for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was considered at P<0.05.  Results out of a total of 210 participants, 194 were willing to participate and were studied. Of the 194 participants, 109 (56.2%) were males. The mean age of the participants was 33.62±11.44 years; range 18 to 66 years. The majority, 123(63.41%), of the participants were taking two antiepileptic medications. Sixty two (32%) of the participants were adherent to their treatment. The most common reported reasons for non-adherence were forgetfulness 49(75.4%) and run out of pills 7(10.8%). Factors that affect medication adherence are epilepsy treatment for <1 year (P = 0.011), epilepsy treatment for 1–3 years (P = 0.002), epilepsy treatment for 3–5 years (P = 0.007), being married (P = 0.006), grade 9–12 education (P = 0.028), college or university education (P = 0.002) and absence of co-morbidity (P = 0.008).  Conclusions The rate of adherence observed in this study was low. The most common reason for non- adherence was forgetfulness. Therefore, the hospital should devise strategies to improve adherence of epileptic patients at the hospital.  MP: Background: Antiepileptic drugs are effective in the treatment of epilepsy, but poor adherence to medication is major problem to sustained remission and to functional restoration. Poor adherence to treatment is one of many reasons for pharmacological treatment failure and seizure recurrence. Even though there were studies on the magnitude and associated factors of Antiepileptic drugs non-adherence, there is a shortage of published information regarding the prevalence and associated factors of Antiepileptic drugs none-adherence in Ethiopia. Objective: To assess prevalence and associated factors of antiepileptic drug none-adherence among epileptic patients attending at Dilla University Referral Hospital. Methods: Institutional based cross sectional study design was conducted at Dilla University Referral Hospital from March to May, 2016. A total of 265 individuals was selected by simple random sampling method and interviewed by using structured questionnaire 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used to assess the prevalence of antiepileptic drug non adherence. Data was coded and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Results: The prevalence of Antiepileptic’s drug none-adherence in this study was 38.1% and getting medication by payment [AOR= 2.009, 95%, CI: 1.044, 3.868], Patients who did not got health information about (their illness, duration of treatment and drug side effect],[AOR= 0.319, 95%, CI: 0.184, 0.534], poor social support [AOR= 3.06, 95%, CI: 1.47-6.37], skip dose [AOR= 2.462, 95%, CI: 1.375, 4.407], patients who were on treatment for 2-5 years [AOR= 1.48, 95%, CI: 0.722, 3.035] were found to be significantly associated (p< 0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of antiepileptic drug none-adherence among patients with epilepsy disorder was found 38.1%. Getting medication by payment, did not receive health information about [the illness, duration of treatment, medication side effect], skip dose, on treatment for 2-5 years, and poor social support were found to be the independent predictor of antiepileptic drug none-adherence.  MP: An epileptic seizure is a clinical event presumed to result from an abnormal and excessive neuronal discharge. The clinical symptoms are paroxysmal and may include impaired consciousness and motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic events perceived by the subject or an observer. Epilepsy occurs when 2 or more epileptic seizures occur unprovoked by any immediately identifiable cause.

"Computed tomography (CT) is often performed to complement ultrasound following detection of focal liver lesions (FLL). There is no consensus in the literature regarding the CT features that might be helpful in the distinction between benign and malignant FLL. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify, based on the available literature, the qualitative and quantitative CT features able to distinguish between benign and malignant FLL. Studies on the diagnostic accuracy of CT in characterising FLL were searched in MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), receiver operator curve (ROC) area, were calculated for qualitative features. DOR were used to determine which qualitative features were most informative to detect malignancy; quantitative features were selected/identified based on standardised mean difference (SMD).  Well-defined margins, presence of a capsule, abnormal lymph nodes, and heterogeneity in the arterial, portal and delayed phase were classified as informative qualitative CT features. The pooled sensitivity ranged from 0.630 (abnormal lymph nodes) to 0.786 (well-defined margins), while pooled specificity ranged from 0.643 (well-defined margins) to 0.816 (heterogeneous in delayed phase). Maximum dimensions, ellipsoid volume, attenuation of the liver in the pre-contrast phase, and attenuation of the liver in the arterial, portal, and delayed phase were found to be informative quantitative CT features. Larger maximum dimensions and volume (positive SMD), and lower attenuation values (negative SMD) were more associated with malignancy. This meta-analysis provides the evidence base for the interpreting CT imaging in the characterization of FLL.","MP: To describe the computed tomographic (CT) features of focal liver lesions (FLLs) in dogs, that could enable predicting lesion histotype. Dogs diagnosed with FLLs through both CT and cytopathology and/or histopathology were retrospectively collected. Ten qualitative and 6 quantitative CT features have been described for each case. Lastly, a machine learning-based decision tree was developed to predict the lesion histotype. Four categories of FLLs - hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 13), nodular hyperplasia (NH, n = 19), other benign lesions (OBL, n = 18), and other malignant lesions (OML, n = 19) - were evaluated in 69 dogs. Five of the observed qualitative CT features resulted to be statistically significant in the distinction between the 4 categories: surface, appearance, lymph-node appearance, capsule formation, and homogeneity of contrast medium distribution. Three of the observed quantitative CT features were significantly different between the 4 categories: the Hounsfield Units (HU) of the radiologically normal liver parenchyma during the pre-contrast scan, the maximum dimension, and the ellipsoid volume of the lesion. Using the machine learning-based decision tree, it was possible to correctly classify NHs, OBLs, HCCs, and OMLs with an accuracy of 0.74, 0.88, 0.87, and 0.75, respectively. The developed decision tree could be an easy-to-use tool to predict the histotype of different FLLs in dogs. Cytology and histology are necessary to obtain the final diagnosis of the lesions  MP: Thus far, there are few computed tomography (CT) characteristics that can distinguish benign and malignant etiologies. The criteria are complex, subjective, and difficult to use in clinical applications due to the high level of experience needed. This study aimed to identify practical CT variables and their clinical relevance for broadly classifying histopathological diagnoses as benign or malignant. In this prospective study, all dogs with liver nodules or masses that underwent CT examination and subsequent histopathological diagnosis were included. Signalments, CT findings and histopathological diagnoses were recorded. Seventy liver nodules or masses in 57 dogs were diagnosed, comprising 18 benign and 52 malignant lesions. Twenty-three qualitative and quantitative CT variables were evaluated using univariate and stepwise multivariate analyses, respectively. Two variables, namely, the postcontrast enhancement pattern of the lesion in the delayed phase (heterogeneous; odds ratio (OR): 14.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82–262.03, P=0.0429) and the maximal transverse diameter of the lesion (>4.5 cm; OR: 33.3, 95% CI: 2.29–484.18, P=0.0006), were significantly related to the differentiation of benign from malignant liver lesions, with an area under the curve of 0.8910, representing an accuracy of 88.6%. These findings indicate that features from triple-phase CT can provide information for distinguishing pathological varieties of focal liver lesions and for clinical decision making. Evaluations of the maximal transverse diameter and postcontrast enhancement pattern of the lesion included simple CT features for predicting liver malignancy with high accuracy in clinical settings.  MP: OBJECTIVE To determine clinical relevance for quantitative and qualitative features of canine hepatic masses evaluated by use of triphasic CT and B-mode, color flow, power, and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography and to compare diagnostic accuracy of these modalities for predicting mass type on the basis of histopathologic classification.  ANIMALS 44 client-owned dogs.  PROCEDURES Dogs with histopathologic confirmation (needle core, punch, or excisional biopsy) of a hepatic mass were enrolled. Triphasic CT and B-mode, color flow, power, and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography of each hepatic mass were performed. Seventy quantitative and qualitative variables of each hepatic mass were recorded by 5 separate observers and statistically evaluated with discriminant and stepwise analyses. Significant variables were entered in equation-based predictions for the histopathologic diagnosis.  RESULTS An equation that included the lowest delayed-phase absolute enhancement of the mass and the highest venous-phase mass conspicuity was used to correctly classify 43 of 46 (93.5%) hepatic masses as benign or malignant. An equation that included only the lowest delayed-phase absolute enhancement of the mass could be used to correctly classify 42 of 46 (91.3%) masses (with expectation of malignancy if this value was < 37 Hounsfield units). For ultrasonography, categorization of the masses with cavitations as malignant achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 80.4%.  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Triphasic CT had a higher accuracy than ultrasonography for use in predicting hepatic lesion classification. The lowest delayed-phase absolute enhancement of the mass was a simple calculation that required 2 measurements and aided in the differentiation of benign versus malignant hepatic masses.  MP: Ability to noninvasively differentiate malignant from nonmalignant abdominal masses would aid clinical decision making. The aim of this retrospective, cross-sectional study was to identify features in dual-phase computed tomographic (CT) studies that could be used to distinguish malignant from nonmalignant hepatic and splenic masses in dogs. Medical records were searched for dogs that had an abdominal dual-phase CT examination, a hepatic or splenic mass, and subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. Computed tomographic images for all included dogs were acquired prior to and <30 s (early phase) and >60 s (delayed phase) after intravenous contrast administration. Fifty-two dogs with 55 masses were studied: 24 hepatic, including 14 (58%) malignant and 10 (42%) non-malignant; 31 splenic, including 18 (58%) malignant and 13 (42%) nonmalignant. There was substantial overlap in the pre- and postcontrast CT features of malignant and nonmalignant hepatic and splenic masses. Regardless of histologic diagnosis, hepatic masses most frequently showed marked, generalized enhancement in early phase images that persisted in the delayed phase. Splenic hemangiosarcoma and nodular hyperplastic lesions most frequently showed marked, generalized enhancement in early phase images that persisted in delayed images whereas most splenic hematomas had slight enhancement in early phase images. All splenic hematomas and 77% of the hemangiosarcomas had contrast accumulation compatible with active hemorrhage. There were no other significant differences in quantitative or categorical CT data between malignant and nonmalignant hepatic or splenic masses. Dual-phase CT of dogs with hepatic or splenic masses provides limited specific diagnostic information.  MP: The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of triple-phase helical computed tomography (CT) for differentiating canine hepatic masses. Seventy dogs with hepatic masses underwent triple-phase CT followed by surgical removal of the hepatic masses. Triple-phase helical CT scans for each dog included precontrast, arterial phase, portal venous phase, and delayed phase studies. The removed hepatic masses were histopathologically classified as hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 47), nodular hyperplasia (n = 14), and hepatic metastatic tumors (n = 9) in dogs. Of the 47 hepatocellular carcinomas, the most common CT findings included a heterogeneous pattern with hyper-, iso-, and hypoenhancement in both the arterial and portal venous phases (40/47, 85.1%). Of the 14 nodular hyperplasias, the most common CT findings were a homogeneous pattern with hyper- and isoenhancement in both the portal venous and delayed phases (13/14, 92.9%). Of nine hepatic metastatic tumors, the most common CT findings included a homogeneous hypoenhancement pattern in both the arterial and portal venous phases (8/9, 88.9%). In addition, 5 (55.6%) showed homogeneous hypoenhancement patterns in the delayed phase. Findings from our study indicated that triple-phase CT is a useful tool for preoperative differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma, nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic metastatic tumors in dogs.  MP: Little information is available on the relationship between computed tomography (CT) imaging findings and the pathologic diagnosis of canine hepatic tumors. Our purpose was to clarify the characteristic features of CT findings in liver tumors in dogs. Data from 33 dogs with either a hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 14, hepatocellular adenoma, n = 14, or nodular hyperplasia, n = 5 were summarized from medical records. CT features for each histologic diagnosis were characterized and analyzed statistically. Common findings in hepatocellular carcinoma included central (79%, P = 0.0030) and marginal enhancement (93%, P = 0.00043) in the arterial phase, cyst-like lesions (93%), capsule formation (93%), and hypoattenuation in the portal (86%), and equilibrium phases (93%). Hepatic adenoma was characterized by a characteristic diffuse enhancement pattern during the arterial phase (57%, P = 0.013), which was also found in nodular hyperplasia (60%), but never in hepatocellular carcinoma. Nodular hyperplasia was less likely to have a capsule structure (20%, P = 0.0087). Mass size was significantly smaller in nodular hyperplasia than in hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic adenoma (P = 0.0033 and 0.038, respectively). Hyperattenuation in the arterial and the portal phase i.e. contrast retention, was more frequent in hepatic adenoma than in the other groups (P = 0.037 and 0.037, respectively). Nodular hyperplasia was more frequently isoattenuating in the equilibrium phase (P = 0.043).  MP: Dynamic liver CT scanning is used to observe the hemodynamics of hepatic tumor-like lesions by taking images sequentially after administration of contrast media. In this study in dogs, we compared the hemodynamic patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the malignant tumors, and nodular hyperplasia (NH), a benign tumor that is more common in older dogs. Thirty-six dogs with HCC and 40 dogs with NH, which were histopathologically diagnosed at Taniura Animal Hospital, were used as subjects. Dynamic CT scanning was performed and the data of each scanning phase were collected. Dilated blood vessels, septum formation, and capsule formation were noted in the tumors from 25, 17, and 25 animals with HCC, respectively. In the arterial phase, high density and low contrast were noted in 8 and 23 dogs, respectively. Low density was noted in 34 dogs in the equilibrium phase. In contrast, no dilated blood vessels, septum formation, or capsule formation was noted in the dogs with NH. High density, low contrast, and low density were noted in 8, 9, and 23 dogs, respectively, in the arterial phase. In the equilibrium phase, the enhancement level was equal to the surrounding liver tissues in all animals. The CT values of HCC in the plain, the arterial phase, portal venous phase and equilibrium phase after the administration of contrast media, were significantly (p < 0.05 to 0.001) lower than those of the surrounding liver tissues. In the arterial phase, the percent incidence of low density was significantly less in HCC than NH, while that of low contrast was significantly greater (p < 0.001) in HCC than NH. Dynamic CT scanning identified differences between the hemodynamics and internal structures of HCC and NH in dogs. Dynamic liver CT scanning can therefore be considered a useful technique in the differential diagnosis of hepatic tumor-like lesions in dogs."
"Background and aims The objective of this meta-analysis was to review the diagnostic performance of anti-dsDNA testing, to determine whether test specificity meets the revised 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The new criteria state that anti-dsDNA testing should be conducted using “an immunoassay with demonstrated ≥ 90% specificity for SLE against relevant disease controls”.  Materials and methods A systematic review (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and DARE) identified cross-sectional or case-control studies published January 2004 to August 2019, reporting anti-dsDNA test accuracy data. Studies included cases of SLE (confirmed using one or more of three validated SLE classification criteria sets) and a disease control group. Data were adjusted to exclude healthy controls. A hierarchical, bivariate mixed-effect meta-analysis of eligible quantitative studies was conducted in STATA MP v16.1 to produce a pooled estimate of sensitivity and specificity.  Results The review identified six fluorescence immunoassay (FEIA) dsDNA studies (1977 total patients, of whom 47% had SLE) eligible to be included in quantitative meta-analysis and all reported a point estimate >90% for specificity. The meta-analysis estimated a pooled specificity of 94.7% (95% CI 91.67%–96.67%).  Conclusion The meta-analysis has demonstrated that the specificity of FEIA dsDNA is ≥90% for SLE, against relevant disease controls, and therefore performs in accordance with the 2019 classification criteria.","MP: Background: This study was devised to assess the performance of anti-ribosomal P (anti-Rib-P) antibodies in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the association of these antibodies with the clinical features of SLE. Methods: We used a fluorescence enzyme immunoassay to determine anti-Rib-P levels in an SLE group, a rheumatic disease control (RDC) group (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis), and a healthy control (HC) group. We also determined anti-Smith antigen (anti-Sm) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the best cut-off points for positivity were determined. Using regression analysis, the relationship between clinical variables and autoantibody levels was analyzed. Results: In total, 127 patients with SLE, 256 controls with other rheumatic diseases, and 100 HCs were studied. Anti-Rib-P autoantibodies were positive in 18 (14.2%) of the patients with SLE (mean concentration of 30.6 ± 46.9 U/ml) and in 2 patients with RA (0.8% of the RDC group). In addition, 12 patients with SLE (9.4%) were positive for anti-Sm (31.1 ± 40.8 U/ml) and 63 (49.6%) were positive for anti-dsDNA autoantibodies (88.4 ± 88.5 U/ml). When we assessed the 18 patients with SLE who had tested positive for anti-Rib-P, we found that 4 of these were positive for anti-Rib-P only, whereas 12 were positive for anti-Rib-P plus anti-dsDNA, and 2 were positive for all three antibodies. There were no samples positive for anti-Rib-P plus anti-Sm. The specificity, sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of anti-Rib-P for SLE diagnosis were 99.4%, 14.2%, 23.7%, and 0.86%, respectively. Caucasian ethnicity was associated with lower anti-Rib-P antibody levels. No relation was found between anti-Rib-P levels and neuropsychiatric or other clinical features. Conclusions: Anti-Rib-P autoantibodies have high specificity for SLE, and measurement of these might improve the accuracy of SLE diagnosis. In this study, we found that Caucasian ethnicity was associated with lower anti-Rib-P antibody levels.  MP: Objective. Auto-antibodies directed to dsDNA (anti-dsDNA) are used in diagnosis and follow-up for SLE. However, multiple assays are used. The objective of this study was to determine the best-performing assays, especially in prediction of exacerbations. Methods. Seven assays were compared during LN (n = 58). The two assays with the most frequent positive results during active nephritis were selected and tested in 152 SLE patients with quiescent disease, 40 with active disease and 214 disease controls. Furthermore, longitudinal samples of SLE patients with and without exacerbations were examined to determine the positive predictive value of an increase for an exacerbation. Results. Of seven assays, results of the Farr (Siemens) and enzyme-labelled anti-isotype assay (EliA) (ThermoFisherScientific) were foremost associated with active nephritis (both 95%). Sensitivity in active SLE was equal using Farr or EliA (95 vs 93%). In quiescent disease, the specificity of EliA was higher (Farr: 53% vs EliA: 91%). In longitudinal analyses, a 25% increase of anti-dsDNA preceded an exacerbation in 75 vs 69% (Farr vs EliA). In SLE patients without exacerbations (n = 42), a rise was seen in 10 vs 12%. Increases in anti-dsDNA occurred more often prior to nephritis (n = 17) compared with non-nephritic flares (n = 17), which was not different between both assays (Farr: 82 and 66%, respectively; EliA: 93 and 43%, respectively). Conclusion. Anti-dsDNA is most frequently positive using Farr and EliA during active nephritis, with comparable sensitivity. Both assays performed equally during exacerbations. However, EliA had higher specificity in quiescent disease and had several advantages, including no use of radioactive materials and less time required.   MP: Objective. Analysis of antibodies against dsDNA is an important diagnostic tool for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and changes in anti-dsDNA antibody levels are also used to assess disease activity. Herein, 4 assays were compared with regard to SLE specificity, sensitivity, and association with disease activity variables.  Methods. Cross-sectional sera from 178 patients with SLE, of which 11 were followed consecutively, from a regional Swedish SLE register were analyzed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-dsDNA by bead-based multiplex assay (FIDIS; Theradig), fluoroenzyme-immunoassay (EliA; Phadia/Thermo Fisher Scientific), Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test (CLIFT; ImmunoConcepts), and line blot (EUROLINE; Euroimmun). All patients with SLE fulfilled the 1982 American College of Rheumatology and/or the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC-12) classification criteria. Healthy individuals (n = 100), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 95), and patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (n = 54) served as controls.  Results. CLIFT had the highest SLE specificity (98%) whereas EliA had the highest sensitivity (35%). When cutoff levels for FIDIS, EliA, and EUROLINE were adjusted according to SLICC-12 (i.e., double the reference limit when using ELISA), the specificity and sensitivity of FIDIS was comparable to CLIFT. FIDIS and CLIFT also showed the highest concordance (84%). FIDIS performed best regarding association with disease activity in cross-sectional and consecutive samples. Fisher’s exact test revealed striking differences between methods regarding associations with certain disease phenotypes.  Conclusion. CLIFT remains a good choice for diagnostic purposes, but FIDIS performs equally well when the cutoff is adjusted according to SLICC-12. Based on results from cross-sectional and consecutive analyses, FIDIS can also be recommended to monitor disease activity.  MP: Objective: An Italian multicentre study was promoted in order to assess the accuracy of four anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody assays for SLE diagnosis and monitoring. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-three patients with established SLE according to ACR classification criteria were enrolled from 9 centres. They included 59 patients at first evaluation (disease duration <12 months) and 164 with longer disease duration (median disease duration 120 months). The sera from 55 healthy subjects and 161 patients with rheumatic, infectious or neoplastic diseases were tested as controls. SLE activity was measured by ECLAM score. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected in serum by means of FarrzymeTM assay, fluoroenzymeimmunoassay (EliATM), Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence (CLIFT) or Farr radioimmunoassay (Farr). Cut-off values of quantitative assays were chosen by ROC curves analysis. Statistics were conducted by SPSS software package. Results: Sensitivity for SLE diagnosis ranged between 66% with Farrzyme to 95% with Farr, with about 90% specificity for all the methods tested. Farrzyme assay was more specific than the others towards patients with non-SLE connective tissue disease. The four methods were moderately concordant and correlated among them, all showing a positive association with active disease, renal or haematologic involvement, and a negative association with central nervous system disease. Whatever the assay used, anti-dsDNA antibody levels correlated with disease activity with r correlation coefficients ranging from 0.336 to 0.425 (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy for SLE of evaluated anti-dsDNA antibody assays is comparable and potentially improvable especially in terms of specificity. The clinical adherence of the assays confirms the value of anti-dsDNA antibody for SLE monitoring.  MP: Backgrounds: Among anti-double-strand (ds)DNA antibody assays, Farr radioimmunoassay is decreasingly used because it requires radioactive material and is labor intensive. We evaluated the performance of Farr, three commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and the Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test (CLIFT) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Anti-dsDNA antibodies were determined in 99 SLE patients, 101 healthy subjects, and 53 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Results: Farr performed better than the 3 EIAs and CLIFT for the diagnosis of SLE at the manufacturer's cut off and at the cut off set to achieve a specificity of 95%. To achieve a similar level of specificity, some EIAs had a decrease in sensitivity which was dramatic for some tests. Farr was also the best at distinguishing patients with quiescent to mildly active disease from patients with more active disease at the cut off value of 93. IU/ml. Using manufacturer's cut off did not allow distinguishing between patients with quiescent and active SLE. Conclusions: Farr was the best global test to assess the level of anti-dsDNA antibodies for both diagnosis and disease activity evaluation in SLE with adequately determined cut off values. Some EIA had low performances limiting their use in decision-making regarding diagnosis and/or treatment. "
"Background The modified Stoppa (MS) approach is an alternative to the ilioinguinal (IL) approach and three meta-analyses comparing these two approaches for the treatment of acetabular fractures were published previously. The aim of this study was to provide an updated systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the MS approach with the IL approach for the treatment of acetabular fractures and to answer the following question: are the results of the MS approach superior to those of the IL approach in terms of reduction quality, operative time, operative blood loss, complications, and clinical outcomes for treatment of acetabular fractures?  Patients and methods An updated systematic literature review was conducted using relevant original studies from various databases (PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library). Pooling of data was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We calculated the mean differences (MDs) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed based on I2 using the standard Chi2 test. When I2 > 50%, significant heterogeneity was assumed and a random-effects model was applied for the meta-analysis. A fixed-effects model was applied in the absence of significant heterogeneity.  Results Six studies were included in this meta-analysis. The findings demonstrated that the rate of anatomical reduction was significantly higher in the MS approach than in the IL approach (I2 = 0%, OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.13–2.69, p = 0.01), the operative time was significantly shorter in the MS approach than in the IL approach (I2 = 88%, MD = −63.60, 95% CI: −93.01 – (−34.20), p < 0.0001) and operative blood loss was significantly lower in the MS approach than in the IL approach (I2 = 75%, MD = −350.51, 95% CI: −523.45 – (−177.58), p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the rate of nerve injury (I2 = 0%, OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.16–1.39, p = 0.17), the rate of vascular injury (I2 = 0%, OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.17–1.49, p = 0.22), the rate of infection (I2 = 0%, OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.25–1.12, p = 0.10), the rate of heterotopic ossification (I2 = 45%, OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.22–1.85, p = 0.40), and the rate of excellent or good clinical score (I2 = 21%, OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.56–2.38, p = 0.70) between the two approaches.  Discussion The MS approach provided better reduction quality, shorter operative time, lower operative blood loss, although there were no significant differences in the rate of complications, and excellent or good clinical score between the two approaches.","MP: The objective of this study was to determine whether the modified Stoppa approach or the ilioinguinal approach is better for the treatment of acetabular fractures by comparing the results of those 2 approaches. A randomized trial was undertaken of 60 consecutive patients with acetabular fractures treated with either the modified Stoppa or the ilioinguinal approach. In addition to the patients' demographics, the assessed preoperative parameters included fracture pattern, associated injuries, time to surgery, and Injury Severity Score; intraoperative parameters included blood loss and operative time for each procedure; and postoperative parameters included wound drainage, blood transfusion, perioperative complications, early operative complications, late operative complications, quality of reduction, radiological results, and clinical outcomes. The study showed no significant differences in all measured preoperative variables between the 2 groups (all P>.05). In addition, no significant differences were found in the intraoperative complication rate, early operative complication rate, late operative complication rate, quality of reduction, radiological results, and clinical outcomes (all P>.05). However, compared with the ilioinguinal approach, the modified Stoppa approach reduced intraoperative blood loss - and in doing so decreased wound drainage and the need for blood transfusion - and shortened operative time (all P<.05). The authors recommend using the modified Stoppa approach rather than the classical ilioinguinal approach to treat acetabular fractures when anterior exposure of the acetabulum is required.  MP: Background: The modified Stoppa approach was introduced to manage fracture of the anterior column instead of the ilioinguinal approach to reduce morbidity. However there is no clinical evidence to confirm its efficiency. Therefore this study was designed to ascertain: (1) if the Stoppa approach versus ilioinguinal allows less blood loss, (2) if functional and radiological results are superior to that of the ilioinguinal approach, (3) if the rate of complication was different. Hypothesis: The modified Stoppa approach allows less blood loss than the ilioinguinal in management offractures of the anterior column of the acetabulum. Patients and methods: Nineteen patients who were treated with the ilioinguinal approach (Group A) at a mean follow-up of 33 months and 17 patients who were treated with the modified Stoppa approach (Group B) at a mean follow-up of 28.9 months were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were called to the final follow-up examination, mean follow-up durations were set and the functional evaluation of patients was made with measurement of range of motion, Harris Hip Scores (HHS), and Merle D'Aubigné score. Results: Average blood loss was determined at a mean 1170. mL (range, 750-2150. mL) in Group A and at a mean 1110. mL (range, 450-2000. mL) in Group B (P= 0.168). The mean HHS (group A. = 89.4 [73-99] and group B. = 88.4 [75-97]) and Merle D'Aubigné scores (group A. = 16.8 [13-18] and group B. = 16.5 [13-18]) showed no significant difference between the groups (P= 0.169). At the final follow-up, the mean hip flexion was found to be 106.83 ± 12.47 and the hip extension was 10.33 ± 6.12 in Group A, while these values were 103.71 ± 14.32 and 10.69 ± 8.17 in Group B (NS between groups regarding flexion [P= 0.678] and extension [P= 0.445]). The complication rate was 31% in Group A (6 patients) and 23% in Group B (4 patients) (P>. 0.05). Discussion: Both surgical approaches give successful results in the treatment of acetabular fractures. Contrary to expectations, there was no difference in the amount of bleeding at the wound site from the Stoppa technique, even though it is minimally invasive, compared to the ilioinguinal approach. Level of evidence: Level III retrospective case control study.   MP: Objective:  To compare the reduction quality, surgery time, and early postoperative complications between the 2 following surgical approaches: the ilioinguinal and the anterior intrapelvic (AIP or modified Rives–Stoppa).  Design:  Retrospective study.  Patients:  Comparison of 122 patients operated in our center between 1996 and 2003 with the ilioinguinal approach and 103 cases operated between 2004 and 2011 with the AIP approach.  Setting:  Level 1 trauma center, acetabular fracture surgery referral center.  Outcome Measurement:  The patients' demographics, fracture type, fracture reduction quality, surgery time, and postoperative complications were compared.  Results:  Anatomic reduction was achieved in 84 patients (68.9%) treated by the ilioinguinal approach and in 85 patients (82.5%) treated by the AIP approach (P = 0.018). In both the columns, acetabular fracture type anatomic reduction was achieved in 54.2% of the ilioinguinal group and 79.4% of the AIP group (P = 0.018). In the ilioinguinal group, surgery time decreased as the number of surgeries increased (P = 0.021), whereas a similar trend was not found in the AIP group. Fracture type distribution and complication rates were similar for both the groups.  Conclusions:  The AIP approach is a safe alternative that offers better exposure and possibly improved reduction quality of acetabular fractures compared with the ilioinguinal approach. We believe that the major advantage of the AIP approach is that it enables reduction of the posterior column and the quadrilateral plate from the contralateral side and enables application of a buttress plate below the pelvic brim.  MP: In acetabular fractures, the correct choice of the surgical approach is mandatory to achieve accurate reduction and to avoid complications. Anterior approaches include the ilio-inguinal, the Stoppa, the ilio-femoral and the para-rectal exposures. The first two are the most commonly used approaches nowadays. The aim of this study was to compare these two approaches. The standard three window ilio-inguinal approach was compared to the intra-pelvic Stoppa approach with an added iliac window. The study enrolled 54 patients. Patients were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 33 patients presented with acetabular fractures and had ORIF starting with an ilio-inguinal exposure. This group was compared to a second group of 21 patients who were treated with the Stoppa/iliac window approach. All patients were treated by one surgical team. The accuracy of reduction, the early clinical results and the approach related complications were compared.   MP: Introduction In performing surgery for fractures of the pelvis and acetabulum, various surgical approaches have been introduced with their own advantages and drawbacks. The extensile nature of ilioinguinal approach gives excellent exposure but was related to wound healing problems. Modified stoppa has a higher difficulty and poses a risk for neurovascular injury. In this study, we elaborate our experience using the Modified Stoppa approach with additional lateral window while adding few modifications to simplify the procedure and facilitate future implant removal. Methods A prospective-retrospective cohort involving 30 anterior pelvic ring and/or anterior column acetabulum fracture patients were conducted from 2012-2016. Fifteen cases were prospectively treated using the modified approach since 2014, while the remaining fifteen cases that were treated using Ilioinguinal approach were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative parameters such as blood loss, duration of surgery, quality of reduction (Matta) and postoperative functional outcome (Majeed and Hannover score) at 12 months period were recorded and evaluated by a blinded reviewer. Result There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean age, sex and fracture type. The mean blood loss in the MIPO group were 325 ± 225 mL versus 710.67 ± 384.51 mL in the control group (p = 0.002). Duration of surgery were 149.33 ± 91.92 minutes in MIPO group versus 235.71 ± 65.79 minutes in ilioinguinal group (p = 0.014). There were no significant differences noted between the two groups in the quality of reduction and postoperative functional outcome, either by using Majeed or Hannover pelvic score. No complications were found after a 12-months follow up period. Two modified cases already had their implant removed and during the procedure, fibrotic tissue were minimal making the implant removal was less complicated and easier. Conclusions Modified stoppa and lateral window technique can be used as a safe and effective alternative approach for anterior pelvic ring fracture and/or anterior column acetabulum fracture. This approach decreased the duration of surgery and blood loss without compromising the quality of reduction and functional outcome in patients.  MP: Background: Fracture acetabulum is a challenging, difficult to treat orthopedic injury due to its location and associated concomitant injuries. The modified Stoppa approach for reduction of fracture acetabulum improves access to quadrilateral surface and posterior column and is considered to be advantageous in many facets of the surgery. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical study was conducted to provide an update on our experience with modified Stoppa as a favorable surgical approach in acetabular fractures. In the period between 2015 and 2017; 18 patients with acetabular fractures operated by the classical ilioinguinal approach were retrospectively reviewed through their medical records as a controlled group and selected 20 patients with acetabular fractures were operated in the period between 2017 and 2019 using the modified Stoppa approach, as a clinical case group. The two groups were compared regarding operative data and postoperative clinical data, complications, and follow up. Cases were operated in Al Zahraa University Hospital and Nasr City Insurance Hospital by the same surgeon and one of the co-authors. Results: (Group A) those operated by ilioinguinal approach and (Group B) those operated using Stoppa approach. The whole study included 25 males (66%); mean age was 41.8 ± 8.42 (range 18-65) years. The mean follow-up period was 18.5 months with 5 patients lost to follow-up. Both column fractures were observed in most of the patients (45%). We observed anatomical reduction, excellent clinical outcome scores in 75% of patients of group B (p = 0.030), and less complications. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that the modified Stoppa approach is the most convenient approach when surgery is required and achieved favorable results in the treatment of anterior acetabular fractures because it improves visualization in lateral compression injuries and allows treatment of both column fractures with single incision. Hence, it is recommended as an alternative to ilioinguinal approach in developing countries. Further, larger-scale comparative studies of the two surgical modalities for different acetabular fracture types and long-term complications are recommended. Trial registration: A retrospective registration is proceeding through Clinicaltrials.gov. Level of evidence: Level III, therapeutic clinical study "
"Numerous studies support the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in children and adolescents. Recent meta-analyses on the efficacy of these interventions in educational settings have found significant improvements in cognitive and behavioral measures with effect sizes ranging from small to moderate. However, no meta-analyses have evaluated the efficacy of MBIs in the Spanish educational setting. In this study, a systematic search of published articles and doctoral theses was performed through March 2022, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as an eligibility criterion. Eighteen studies with 1471 participants were included in the three-level meta-analysis. The overall average effect size was significant (g = 0.62), and significant effect sizes were obtained for all dimensions except for the mindfulness skills dimension, which included the following variables: personal and social development (g = 0.84), mood states (g = 0.44), cognitive functions (g = 0.67), emotional intelligence (g = 0.61), emotional and behavioral adjustment (g = 0.54), and mindfulness skills (g = 0.51). The analysis of the moderating variables showed that all the MBI types analyzed have significant effects, especially among the older participants, and that engaging in home practice and increasing the session duration in minutes improves their effectiveness. The results are relevant for research and for the implementation of mindfulness-based intervention programs in educational centers.","MP: The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of a mindfulness training psycho-educative program on self-efficacy in the academic performance and relaxation states in a sample of High School students. A randomized controlled trial with pretest-posttest measurements was used with an experimental group and a control group (waiting list). The Cartagena Questionnaire (Cartagena, 2008) and the SRSI Questionnaire (Smith, 2005a) were employed. The statistical analyses carried out on the studied variables showed significant improvements in favor of the experimental group compared with the control group on the levels of self-efficacy in academic performance, as well as on the states of basic relaxation, mindfulness and positive energy. The program also produced a significant reduction in the experimental group compared with the control group in the dimension of perceived stress.  MP: Mindfulness is the quality of being conscious and aware of the present moment harmonizing mind and body. This study presents a six-week intervention program carried out in four educational establishments in Granada with 5th and 6th grade primary school students and 1st, 2nd and 3rd year secondary school students. The aim was to find out whether Mindfulness has positive effects in terms of improving students’ attention and reducing stress. The samples were 320 students; a quasi-experimental design was used. We collected socio-demographic and family data and carried out a pre-test to measure the attention variable by means of the d2 questionnaire and the stress variable with the Inventory Questionnaire of Childhood Stress. Following the intervention, we carried out a post-test using the same instruments. A mixed linear model was used to study the effects of the Mindfulness program. The results show that applying a Mindfulness program improves attention and reduces stress in these students, with differences by sex, school- and ages.   MP: This study aims to analyse the effects of two briefs emotional intelligence (EI) program one based on the ability model, INTEMO program, and other based on psychological flexibility protocol with mindfulness strategies, along 5 sessions with 1-hour each. A pretest-posttest quasiexperimental design with two treatments groups; The initial sample was composed by 215 subjects, finally 120 Spanish adolescents (54.2% male, mean age 12 years old) from a compulsory secondary education centre were involved in the study during two months. Results show differences in emotional suppression, emotional regulation and perceived emotional intelligence. Similarity, emotional intelligence and mindfulness abilities has been related. INTEMO program obtain high and significant different punctuation in emotional suppression, emotional regulation and perceived emotional intelligence. In regression analysis some factors were found that can be in the base of the development of emotional intelligence and mindfulness, both are related.  MP: The elastic mechanical behavior of elastic materials is modeled by a pair of independent constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's coefficient). A precise measurement for both constants is necessary in some applications, such as the quality control of mechanical elements and standard materials used for the calibration of some equipment. Ultrasonic techniques have been used because wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of the propagation medium. The ultrasonic test shows better repeatability and accuracy than the tensile and indentation test. In this work, the theoretical and experimental aspects related to the ultrasonic through-transmission technique for the characterization of elastic solids is presented. Furthermore, an amorphous material and some polycrystalline materials were tested. Results have shown an excellent repeatability and numerical errors that are less than 3% in high-purity samples.  MP: Many studies have established a causal relationship between a student’s academic self concept and academic performance, to the point where academic self-concept is considered the basis of a student’s future success or failure (Marsh, 1990; Skaalvik & Hagtvet, 1990), finding that a high self-concept contributes to scholastic success, which in turn favors development of a positive self-concept (Liu, Kaplan, & Risser, 1992; Roberts, Sarigiani, Peterson, & Newman, 1993). Corbière, Fraccaroli, Mbekou, and Perron (2006) also found a significant and positive correlation between academic self-concept, academic interest, and academic achievement. Other studies show that the higher a student’s positive self-concept is, the better the conditions motivating study (anxiety, concentration and aptitude for school work) and the stronger study and deep-learning strategies used, which also makes positive self-concept favor the student’s use of more cognitive learning strategies, thereby facilitating more profound, elaborate information processing (González-Pienda et al., 2002; Núñez et al., 1998).  This active involvement in the learning process increases when the student feels self-competent believes in his own abilities and has high expectations for self-effectiveness (Millar, Behrens, & Greene, 1993). This also increases when tasks are evaluated and when he feels responsible for the learning goals, which improves his academic performance (Núñez, González-Pienda, García, González-Pumariega, & García, 1995). It has also been demonstrated that high levels of stress in the academic environment cause attention and concentration deficits, difficulties in memorizing and problem solving, deficits in study skills, low productivity and academic performance (Pérez, Martín, Borda, & Del Río, 2003).  Anxiety is also one of the main factors negatively affecting academic performance. Carbonero (1999) says that anxiety can lead to deterioration of academic performance because the student focuses on negative thoughts about his abilities more than on the task itself. Rivas (1997) notes that students with high anxiety levels tend to focus their attention on how hard the task is, on their academic failures and on their lack of personal skills. High levels of anxiety therefore tend to alter the student’s psychological functioning to the extent that memory, attention and concentration are affected and diminished, disturbing academic performance, as this requires attention, concentration and sustained effort to be maintained at an optimum, effective level (Rains, 2004). Research, such as the studies by Del Barrio (1997) and Mestre (1992) has demonstrated both an increase in emotional disorders (anxiety and depression) in teenagers, as well as the relationship between these disorders and the student’s academic performance. Therefore, promoting and training the affective strategies based on self-control, techniques increasing attention and improving self-knowledge, can exert a positive effect on the student’s academic performance (Camero, Martín, & Herrero, 2000).  MP: This chapter talks about few scenes in Jean Georges Noverre’s production of Dido and Aeneas, documented in his 1766 anthology of ballets Theorie et Pratique. As the ballet opens, Dido wrestles with her feelings of love for Aeneas. Even as she strives to release herself from this growing passion, Amour, appearing in disguised form, re-enflames her desire so that she can only think of pleasing her conqueror. Stage directions: Receive e-mail inviting me to participate in a conference with a contribution that brings feminist methodology to bear on an eighteenth-century case study. In the forest where the hunt will take place, Juno, Venus, Amour, and Hymen plot Dido’s defeat. Renowned story ballet choreographers Noverre and Gasparo Angiolini both produced versions of Dido’s story in 1766 and 1765 respectively. Back in Dido’s palace in Carthage, Aeneas dreams that he must abandon Dido in order to fulfill his destiny.   MP: Two of the problems that currently affect a large proportion of university students are high levels of anxiety and stress experienced in different situations, which are particularly high during the first years of their degree and during exam periods. The present study aims to investigate whether mindfulness training can bring about significant changes in the manifestations of depression, anxiety, and stress of students when compared to another group undergoing a physical activity program and a control group. The sample consisted of 125 students from the Bachelor of Education Program. The measuring instrument used was the Abbreviated Scale of Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21). The results indicate that the effects of reducing the identified variables were higher for the mindfulness group than for the physical education group and for the control group F(2) = 5.91, p = .004, η2 = .106. The total scores for all variables related to the mindfulness group decreased significantly, including an important stress reduction t(29) = 2.95, p = .006, d = .667. Mindfulness exercises and some individual relaxing exercises involving Physical Education could help to reduce manifestations of stress and anxiety caused by exams in students.  MP: The present study compares the effects of three mind/body programs on stress, anxiety and depression among a sampling of university students. These three programs, which are currently experiencing great popularity, are Mindfulness, Tai Chi and Yoga. 282 undergraduate teaching students participated in this research. They were chosen as candidates because, in the future, as working professionals they will be exposed to high levels of stress and, at present, as students they suffer high levels of anxiety during exam periods. 85 students were randomly assigned to a Yoga group, 68 to a Tai Chi group, 84 to a Mindfulness group, and 45 comprised the control group. Tai Chi and Yoga significantly reduced anxiety, while Mindfulness had the same effect on stress; nevertheless, all three programs proved effective in the reduction of psychological malaise in comparison with the control group. In terms of general mental health, Mindfulness produced greater overall effects. The control group did not experience any significant changes in relation to the variables evaluated, and the levels of said variables even worsened according to the post-test conducted prior to the exam period.   MP: Introduction: The multicultural coexistence is one of the most important issues in the new educational challenges. In the face of the limitations of the frameworks of prejudice reduction, this problem begins to be addressed from the Cognitive and Behavioural Therapies based on mindfulness and acceptation. This study analyses the influence of a psycho-educational program of training in mindfulness on prejudicial attitude and the discrimination perceived towards Moroccans in a sample of 46 high school students of 4th Grade. Method: The Spanish students who participated in the study were randomly assigned to an experimental group (N = 23), who was involved in a meditation program, and a control group (N = 23). The study presents a cuasiexperimental design with three phases: pretest, postest, and follow-up. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess whether there were significant differences between the control and the experimental group, whereas the Wilcoxon test was used in order to assess whether there were significant differences among different phases of the study, in both groups. Results: Results showed a decrease of two components of prejudice attitude towards Moroccans in the experimental group (affective and connative) compared to the control group. Experimental group showed less negative emotions and less preferred social distance towards Moroccans, as well as more positive emotions, and more perceived discrimination towards this ethnic group when they finished the meditation program, compared to the pre-test levels. These effects were relatively permanent. Discussion and Conclusion: These results show that the psychological frameworks of new generation based on mindfulness can represent an useful and alternative tool in order to decrease prejudice (especially their affective components) towards ethnic minorities. Moreover, this approach seems to be more adapted to teenagers and to new implicit prejudice.  MP: The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based social–emotional learning program (MindKinder) on the psychosocial adjustment and neuropsychological development of kindergarten children. The experimental cohort comprised 74 kindergarten children, a cohort obtained through an incidental non-probability sampling method or by accessibility. The children were randomly assigned to control (n = 26; 35.14%) or experimental groups (n = 48; 65.86%). The age of children ranged from 4 to 6 years (M = 5.08, SD =.37). The study followed a quasi-experimental design with repeated pre-test, post-test, and follow-up (after 6 months) measurements with a control group. The MindKinder program was implemented during school time. Results confirmed that the program produced a significant improvement in the psychosocial adjustment and neuropsychological variables in the experimental group. Results showed a significant reduction in the scores of some global maladaptive dimensions among the experimental group: behavioral symptoms index and externalized and academic problems. Likewise, the results show a significant increase in the scores for the experimental group in the dimensions of global development, non-verbal development, visual perception, and attention. Our findings suggest that mindfulness programs may be effective in promoting psychosocial adjustment and improving neuropsychological variables in young children. Implications are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.  MP: The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the mindfulness Mindkinder-based programme on school adjustment, school behavioural problems and school outcomes in elementary education students. A quasi-experimental design of repeated pretest-posttest measures with control group is used. The participants in the study were 118 students (55.2% were girls and 44.8% were boys). The age of children ranged from 5 to 6 years (M = 5.69, SD = 0.37). The programme is implemented during school time. The results show that the program promoted in the experimental groups some significant improvement in school adjustment variables, school behavioural problems and school outcomes. These results suggest that mindfulness programmes can be effective in promoting school adjustment and improving school outcomes in childhood. The implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations are formulated for future research.  MP: There are few studies on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in primary education settings, specifically in rural schools, despite the potential beneficial effects on mood state, attention, and concentration. This study compares two groups of 45 children, ages 6 to 13 from a rural school. The experimental group participated in a 6-week, daily MBI program which trained their attention to breathing, to the senses, and to the body. Meanwhile the control group was assigned to a waiting list. Following the intervention, the MBI group improved mood state, concentration, and immediate auditory-verbal memory. However, there were no significant results regarding focused attention and working memory. These results show that MBI in a rural setting is feasible and produces beneficial results in the short term. Research needs to be done over a longer period in order to identify all the possible effects of continued practice of mindfulness in a school setting.  MP: "
"Background Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common neuropsychological complication after a stroke with a range of poor outcomes. Evidence of gut microbiota disorder for PSD has recently accumulated. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the association between PSD and gut microbiota.  Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and VIP, CNKI, Wangfang without language restrictions for eligible studies and performed a meta-analysis and systematic review to assess the pooled differences in gut microbiota compositions between PSD and healthy individuals.  Results We included nine eligible studies reporting the differences in the intestinal microbiome between PSD and healthy control. The pooled results demonstrated that the sequencing depth index (Good's coverage), richness indexes (Chao1 and ACE), evenness, and alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson) were not significantly changed in PSD patients as compared to healthy controls. The observed species (operational taxonomic unit, OUT) in PSD was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals (SMD, 1.86, 95%CI: 1.47 to 2.25). Furthermore, we observed significant differences between PSD and healthy individuals at the phylum level. The pooled estimation of relative abundance of Proteobacteria (SMD, 0.37, 95%CI: 0.19 to 0.55), Bacteroidetes (SMD, 1.87, 95%CI: 1.25 to 2.48), and Fusobacteria (SMD, 1.06, 95%CI: 0.76 to 1.37) in patients with PSD significantly was increased as compared to controls, while the pooled relative abundance of Firmicutes (SMD, -0.84, 95%CI: -1.21 to -0.47) was significantly decreased in PSD as compared to healthy controls. Moreover, significant differences in intestinal microbiota were observed between PSD patients and healthy controls at the family and genus levels.  Conclusions This meta-analysis indicates a significant alteration of observed species and microbiota composition at the phylum, family and genus levels in PSD as compared to healthy individuals.","MP: Objective: To investigate the correlation between intestinal flora and serum inflammatory factors IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and hs-CRP in post-stroke depression (PSD) in ischemic stroke patients. Study Design: Observational study. Study Place and Duration of Study: Jiulongpo District Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chongqing City, China, from October 2018 to May 2020. Methodology: One hundred and sixty-three patients with ischemic stroke were divided into Group A (PSD) and Group B (no PSD), according to whether they had PSD. Intestinal flora indexes (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium) and serum IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and hs-CRP were detected. Results: Among 163 patients with ischemic stroke, 67 (41.10%) had PSD (Group A) and 96 (58.90%) had no PSD (Group B). Contents of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in Group A were higher than those in Group B (both p <0.001), and content of Bifidobacterium in Group A was lower than that in Group B (p <0.001). Serum IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and hs-CRP levels in Group A were higher than those in Group B (all p <0.001). Pearson correlation test showed that contents of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in Group A were positively correlated with IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and hs-CRP, and content of Bifidobacterium was negatively correlated with IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and hs-CRP. Conclusion: There are intestinal flora imbalance and Bifidobacterium undergrowth in patients with PSD, which can lead to overexpression of serum inflammatory factors. Both may be involved in occurrence and progress of PSD in patients with ischemic stroke. © 2021 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.  MP: Background:Post-stroke comorbid cognitive impairment and depression (PSCCID) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication after acute stroke. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in the composition of gut microbiota may serve as a critical role in patients with PSCCID. Objective:We aimed to characterize the microbial profiles of patients with PSCCID. Method:A total of 175 stroke patients were recruited in the study. The composition of gut bacterial communities of patients was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA Miseq sequencing, and Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States was used to demonstrate the functional alterations of gut microbiota. We further identified the characteristic gut microbiota of PSCCID using linear discriminant analysis effect size. Results:Patients with PSCCID exhibited an increased abundance of Proteobacteria, including Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriales, and Enterobacteriaceae, and a decreased abundance of several short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria compared with non-PSCCID patients. The abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae showed negative correlations with the MoCA score. Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results demonstrated the enriched orthologs of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism and decreased orthologs of amino acid metabolism in PSCCID patients. Importantly, the characteristic gut microbiota was identified and achieved an area under the curve of 0.847 between the two groups. Conclusion:In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota of PSCCID patients, and revealed the correlations of the altered gut microbiota with clinical parameters, which took a further step towards non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for PSCCID from fecal samples.  MP: Objective To investigate the changes in the population and distribution intestinal microflora and their relationship with depression in post-stroke patients. Methods Fecal specimens were obtained from 32 patients with post-stroke depression and 30 healthy adults for gene sequencing of 16S RNA V3 region of the intestinal microorganism using Roche/45 high-throughput sequencing platform. Results The genus and species of intestinal bacteria showed significant differences between the post-stroke patients and health adults. Conclusion Significant changes in the structure of intestinal flora occur in patients with post-stroke depression.  MP: "
